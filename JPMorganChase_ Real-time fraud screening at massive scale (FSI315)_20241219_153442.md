# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - JPMorganChase_ Real-time fraud screening at massive scale (FSI315).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **JPMorgan Chase's Fraud Detection Platform**
   - Built on AWS to combat fraud in real-time for payment transactions across the globe
   - Handles high volumes of transactions (tens of millions per day) with low latency
   - Designed for high availability, resiliency, and scalability
   - Utilizes machine learning models, rules, anomaly detection, and exception lists

2. **Architecture and Components**
   - Microservices architecture with separate components for request ingestion, prioritization, data enrichment, feature engineering, rule execution, model scoring, and action handling
   - Leverages AWS services like EKS, DynamoDB, Aurora, S3, and Lambda
   - Feature engineering plays a crucial role, with a feature registry, batch and real-time feature calculation, and materialization in DynamoDB

3. **Infrastructure Optimizations**
   - Reduced network layers and latency using AWS Load Balancer Controller and VPC Endpoints
   - Optimized auto-scaling and resource utilization
   - Built-in resiliency at multiple levels (service, availability zone, and region)
   - Isolation of different payment patterns into separate AWS accounts and namespaces

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - Treated as a non-functional requirement from day one
   - On-demand usage of environments, observability metrics, and cost champions
   - Shutdown of unused environments and right-sizing of resources

5. **Key Takeaways**
   - Focus on business capabilities rather than infrastructure maintenance
   - Strong foundation for extreme scale and future growth
   - Cost optimization and security as day-one activities

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- JPMorgan Chase has built a highly scalable, resilient, and cost-optimized fraud detection platform on AWS to protect their payment transactions globally.
- The platform leverages various AWS services and architectural patterns to achieve low latency, high availability, and cost efficiency.
- Feature engineering and rule execution play crucial roles in detecting fraud, with a dedicated feature registry and rule authoring system.
- Infrastructure optimizations, such as reducing network layers, optimizing auto-scaling, and ensuring resiliency at multiple levels, contribute to the platform's performance and reliability.
- Cost optimization is treated as a non-functional requirement from the design phase, with measures like on-demand usage, observability metrics, and cost champions in place.
- The platform enables JPMorgan Chase to focus on delivering business capabilities and fraud prevention solutions while leveraging AWS's managed services and scalability.
