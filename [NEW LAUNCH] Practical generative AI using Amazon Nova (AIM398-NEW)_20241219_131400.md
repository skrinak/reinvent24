# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - [NEW LAUNCH] Practical generative AI using Amazon Nova (AIM398-NEW).txt

# Summary: Amazon Nova - Practical Generative AI

## Overview

- Amazon Nova is a new foundational model family launched by AWS for building generative AI applications.
- It consists of six models: four for understanding (Micro, Lite, Pro, Premier) and two for creative content generation (Canvas, Reel).
- The models are designed to be fast, cost-effective, and easy to use with data and systems, supporting a wide range of tasks across 200 languages and multiple modalities.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Understanding Models

- **Micro**: Fastest and most cost-effective for text-to-text tasks, supports context length of 128K.
- **Lite**: Multimodal capabilities at an accessible price point, supports context length of 300K, natively processes images and documents.
- **Pro**: Advanced model for complex multimodal use cases like video understanding, supports context length of 300K.
- **Premier** (coming soon): Highest capability model.

### Creative Content Generation Models

- **Canvas**: High-quality image generation and editing model, supports advanced features like camera motion control, up to 2K resolution, and fine-tuning on proprietary data.
- **Reel**: Video generation model supporting text, image, and video inputs, initially supporting 6-second videos with plans for longer formats and editing capabilities.

### Key Differentiators

- Long context performance: Designed for strong retrieval abilities on long documents.
- Customization and performance optimization: Can be fine-tuned to match desired performance and cost targets.
- Industry-leading price-performance: Up to 75% more cost-effective than other models in their respective tiers.
- Native multimodal understanding: Can process images, videos, and documents natively without conversion to text.

## Use Cases and Customer Examples

1. **AWS Support**: Using Nova's Agentic capabilities and fine-tuning for technical troubleshooting, enabling customers to get issues resolved faster through AI assistance.

2. **Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios**: Leveraging Nova's video understanding and long context capabilities to generate high-quality, narrated recaps of entire TV series seasons.

3. **Amazon Q Developer**: Using Nova for accurate and fast inspection of AWS resources, enabling natural language queries about resource states.

4. **Amazon Ads**: Utilizing Nova Reel to generate engaging video ads from existing assets and content, reducing the cost of video ad production.

## Responsible AI Controls
