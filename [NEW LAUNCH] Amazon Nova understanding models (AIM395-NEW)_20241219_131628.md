# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - [NEW LAUNCH] Amazon Nova understanding models ([AIM395-NEW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEzL6VywPBQ)).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Amazon Nova** is a new generation of state-of-the-art foundation models that deliver frontier intelligence at industry-leading price performance.

2. Amazon Nova includes four models in ascending order of intelligence:
   - **Amazon Micro**: Text-only model for low-latency responses at low cost.
   - **Amazon Nova Lite**: Low-cost multimodal model for processing image, text, and video inputs.
   - **Amazon Nova Pro**: Highly capable multimodal model with the best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost.
   - **Amazon Nova Premier**: The most capable multimodal model for complex reasoning and distilling custom models (coming soon).

3. Key capabilities of Amazon Nova models:
   - Frontier intelligence for a broad range of tasks at state-of-the-art accuracy.
   - Designed for fast inference with low latency.
   - Exceptional price performance, offering state-of-the-art intelligence at the lowest cost.
   - Easy to use and effective in agentic applications requiring interaction with proprietary systems and APIs.
   - Deeply integrated with Bedrock, supporting agents, knowledge bases, and guardrails.
   - Support for fine-tuning (Micro, Lite, Pro) and distillation using Nova Pro as a teacher.

4. Amazon Nova models excel in various benchmarks, including language understanding, translation, reasoning, code completion, mathematical problem-solving, visual tasks (chart comprehension, document understanding, visual captioning, question answering), and computer agent benchmarks (Mind2Web, VisualWebBench, GroundUI).

5. Demonstrations showcased Nova's capabilities in:
   - Native video understanding and summarization.
   - Extracting information from handwritten documents.
   - Understanding complex diagrams and suggesting improvements.
   - Powering computer agents that can interact with websites, browsers, and screen-based applications through natural language instructions.
   - Orchestrating multi-step workflows by actuating APIs and browsers (e.g., root-causing service issues).

6. Hearst Corporation's experience with Amazon Nova models:
   - Successful experiments in understanding video ads and providing feedback on their effectiveness.
   - Potential for optimizing workflows, enabling faster and more agile operations, and expanding customer offerings across various verticals (media, finance, automotive, healthcare).
   - Estimated tens of millions of dollars in savings from Nova's capabilities.

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- Amazon Nova models offer state-of-the-art performance, low latency, and exceptional price performance across a wide range of tasks, making them compelling for various applications.
- The combination of visual intelligence, instruction-following, and agentic capabilities unlocks powerful use cases for building computer agents that can interact with websites, browsers, and screen-based applications through natural language instructions.
- Fine-tuning and distillation capabilities allow customers to further improve the accuracy of Nova models for their specific use cases, enhancing the price-performance offering.
- Nova's ability to handle long context lengths (up to 5 million tokens coming soon) and understand multimodal inputs (text, images, video, audio) opens up new possibilities for document processing, information extraction, and content understanding.
- Enterprises like Hearst see tremendous potential in leveraging Nova's capabilities for optimizing workflows, enhancing productivity, and delivering better customer experiences across multiple verticals.
