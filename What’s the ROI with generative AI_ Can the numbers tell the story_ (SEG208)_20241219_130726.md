# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Whatâ€™s the ROI with generative AI_ Can the numbers tell the story_ (SEG208).txt

# Summary

## Introduction
- This session focuses on the ROI (Return on Investment) of generative AI and how companies can measure and achieve it.
- The panelists are executives from OfferUp, AlphaSense, CloudZero, and AI21 Labs, who share their experiences and strategies.

## Balancing Initial Investment vs Long-Term Gains
- Start small with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach, but consider long-term implications.
- Educate employees and executives, learn best practices, and develop KPIs for success.
- Get early wins, learn, and build momentum for larger initiatives.
- Focus on use cases that offer quick wins and build confidence for more complex projects.

## Custom Models vs Pre-Trained Models
- Pre-trained models are often preferable for faster time-to-market and lower maintenance costs.
- Custom models may be necessary for proprietary or highly specialized use cases.
- Start with pre-trained models, then consider fine-tuning or custom models once at scale.
- Leverage techniques like prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation to customize pre-trained models.

## Organizing Stakeholders and Ensuring Alignment
- Transparency, clear unit economics, and well-defined business outcomes are crucial.
- Educate stakeholders on the technology and involve them in decision-making processes.
- Start with internal or contained use cases to mitigate risks and build confidence.
- Over-communicate and set realistic expectations throughout the process.
- Establish cross-functional committees to address concerns from various perspectives.

## Determining Metrics for ROI
- Align metrics with existing business goals and KPIs (e.g., customer acquisition, productivity, revenue).
- For digital native businesses, consider opportunities to increase top-line revenue through new product offerings.
- Track the "cloud efficiency rate" (AI spend / revenue) to measure efficiency and profitability.
- Benchmark against industry standards and adjust expectations based on the project stage.

## Key Takeaways
- Start small, get early wins, and build momentum.
- Leverage pre-trained models and techniques like prompt engineering when possible.
- Align stakeholders through transparency, education, and well-defined business outcomes.
- Determine metrics based on existing goals and track efficiency rates.
- Continuously measure and communicate ROI throughout the project lifecycle.
