# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Accelerate Gen AI: Amazon SageMaker HyperPod Training Plans & Recipes

## Introduction

- The demand for building and training large-scale models has increased significantly in recent years, enabling improvements in existing use cases and new use cases.
- Training these large models comes with challenges, such as:
  - Utilizing the latest hardware (e.g., new NVIDIA GPUs, Trainium instances)
  - Dealing with faults and quickly recovering from failures
  - Meeting predictable timelines and getting products to market faster
  - Optimizing performance through efficient data and model distribution
  - Managing costs for the compute resources required
  - Ensuring efficient and unblocked data science teams

## Amazon SageMaker HyperPod Training Plans

- Announced at re:Invent 2024, HyperPod Training Plans help customers plan their training workloads to meet timelines and budgets.
- Key features and benefits:

  - Powered by EC2 Capacity Blocks to reserve capacity
  - Automatically sets up the training cluster and compute when the plan begins
  - Enables predictable timelines by reserving capacity for specific periods
  - Provides upfront cost visibility and efficient utilization
  - Offers resiliency and high performance through HyperPod's distributed training capabilities

## Amazon SageMaker HyperPod Recipes

- HyperPod Recipes simplify the process of configuring and optimizing foundation model training without sacrificing performance.
- Key features and benefits:
  - Curated, ready-to-use recipes for pre-training and fine-tuning popular foundation models (e.g., Llama, Minstral)
  - Enables starting pre-training and fine-tuning in minutes instead of weeks
  - Leverages the optimized performance, scalability, and resiliency of HyperPod
  - Provides efficient resource utilization and cost optimization
  - Implements automatic model checkpointing techniques
  - Allows easy customization for different sequence lengths, model sizes, and accelerators (GPUs, Trainium)
  - Supports running on SageMaker GPU-optimized models, Neuron-optimized models, and custom models

## Demo

- Demonstrated the use of HyperPod Training Plans and Recipes for fine-tuning the Llama 3-8 billion model with an 8K sequence length on GPUs.
- Showed the process of creating a training plan, associating it with a HyperPod cluster, and executing the fine-tuning recipe using the HyperPod CLI and launcher scripts.
- Highlighted the automatic experiment tracking and TensorBoard integration for visualizing training runs.
