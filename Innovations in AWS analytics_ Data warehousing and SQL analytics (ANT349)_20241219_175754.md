# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Innovations in AWS Analytics: Data Warehousing and SQL Analytics

## Key Trends in Modern Data Warehousing

- Data lakes, data warehouses, and machine learning use cases are converging
- Need for near real-time analytics
- Ease of access and robust security/governance for data democratization

## Amazon Redshift Overview

- First enterprise-grade, fully-managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse
- Used by tens of thousands of customers across industries
- Processing exabytes of data and tens of billions of queries per week

### Product Roadmap Focus Areas

- Price performance
- Converging data lakes and data warehouses (lakehouse architectures)
- Simplifying ingestion and enabling near real-time analytics
- Enabling generative AI applications on Redshift data

## Recent Innovations in Redshift

### Price Performance

- Up to 3x better price performance than alternative cloud data warehouses
- Up to 7x better throughput per dollar for dashboarding applications
- Improved first query response times and data sharing performance
- Smarter Autonomics for sort keys and distribution keys
- RA3.L instances for compute and storage separation
- Graviton support in Serverless for up to 30% better price performance

### Data Sharing and Serverless

- Data sharing enables sharing live, transactionally consistent data across Redshift clusters
- Common deployment patterns: hub-and-spoke, data mesh
- Compute isolation, chargeability, and integration with AWS Data Exchange
- Multi-data warehouse writes (new) for scaling data processing workloads
- Redshift Serverless for automatic provisioning and pay-per-use
- AI-driven scaling and optimizations in Serverless (new, GA)

### Lakehouse Architecture

- SageMaker Lakehouse (new) for unified, open, and secure lakehouse
- Unified view of data in S3 data lakes and Redshift data warehouses
- Open through Iceberg APIs for any compatible engine
- Integrated fine-grained security controls
- Redshift data published to Lakehouse without data movement
- Redshift as a powerful SQL engine on data lake data (Iceberg support)
- Incremental materialized views on data lake tables

### Simplifying Ingestion and Near Real-Time Analytics

- Auto-copy for simplified, automated ingestion from S3 (GA)
- Streaming Ingestion from Amazon Kinesis, Amazon MSK, Confluent Cloud, and self-managed Apache Kafka
- Zero-ETL from operational stores (Aurora MySQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, RDS MySQL, Salesforce, Zendesk)

### Generative AI Integration

- Generative SQL in Redshift Query Editor (GA)
- Redshift integration with Bedrock for invoking foundational models (e.g., Claude, Mistral AI, Amazon Titan)

## Charter Communications' Journey with Redshift

- Migrated from a legacy MPP platform to Redshift in 10 months
- Addressed challenges like resource contention, scalability, and disaster recovery
- Redshift provided fastest performance, storage scaling, and AWS service integration
- Key accelerators: automation, self-service, persona-based training, unit testing
- New architecture with Redshift hub-and-spoke model and workload isolation
- 18% improvement in SLA products, <24 hours for scaling, <24 hours RPO, and 8-hour RTO
- 35% reduction in operating costs
- Enabled by Redshift features like data sharing, generative SQL, scoped permissions, and Autonomics
- Valuable partnership with AWS teams (SCT, solutions architecture, performance, product)
- Future plans: open-source formats, AI for BI, SageMaker Lakehouse, and multi-warehouse writes
