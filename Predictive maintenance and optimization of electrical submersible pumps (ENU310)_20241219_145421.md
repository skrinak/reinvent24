# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 -Predictive maintenance and optimization of electrical submersible pumps (ENU310).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Hydrocarbon Production Challenges**
   - Growing global energy demand requires increasing hydrocarbon production.
   - Challenges include natural production decline from existing reservoirs and high capital costs for new wells.
   - The focus is on maximizing productivity of existing assets while reducing costs and emissions.

2. **Unconventional Operations**
   - ExxonMobil has aggressive growth targets in the Permian Basin, aiming for a 50% production increase by 2027.
   - Unconventional operations face challenges like large well counts, geographic extent, and high downtime percentages.
   - Digital technologies can help optimize well operations, reduce downtime, and improve run life.

3. **Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs)**
   - ESPs are a key artificial lift method used in unconventional operations.
   - The main issue is the short run life of ESPs in unconventional wells compared to conventional wells.
   - Predictive maintenance models trained on historical data can help improve ESP run life.

4. **Collaboration with Baker Hughes**
   - ExxonMobil collaborated with Baker Hughes to leverage their advanced Leucipa model.
   - Leucipa uses an ensemble of physics-based and machine learning models to identify critical conditions and predict remaining useful life of ESPs.
   - The solution provides recommendations for actions to improve ESP run life.

5. **Results and Learnings**
   - The pilot project in the Delaware Basin showed a 10x return on investment and potential for a 10% increase in ESP run life.
   - Key learnings include focusing on high-value use cases, prioritizing progress over perfection, and choosing the right partners.
   - Challenges included handling variable data inputs, effective data labeling, and maintaining audit trails.

6. **Future Vision**
   - ExxonMobil's vision is to move towards system optimization, from sand face to sales point, and democratize insights through a smart digital platform.
   - Baker Hughes envisions a system-driven, recommendation-driven approach to optimize the entire production network.

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- Collaboration between ExxonMobil and Baker Hughes leveraged their respective strengths in data, domain expertise, and technology to develop an effective solution for ESP optimization.
- The Leucipa solution demonstrated promising results in improving ESP run life and generating a positive return on investment in the pilot project.
- Effective data management, model development, and user-friendly deployment were critical success factors for the project.
- The learnings and experience gained from this project will pave the way for broader system optimization and digitalization of production operations in the future.
- The future vision involves transitioning to a more automated, system-driven approach that optimizes the entire production network while managing interdependencies between different components.
