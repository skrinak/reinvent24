# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Cost-optimized and scalable enterprise workloads with Amazon Bedrock (AIM356).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Enterprise Readiness Gap**: Over 80% of companies are investing in generative AI, but only 24% have workloads in production, and only 21% have a good foundation for governance and cost control.

2. **Stages for Deploying Generative AI Applications**:
   - Onboarding and Compliance
   - Application Development
   - Moving to Production

3. **Onboarding and Compliance**:
   - Model choice and flexibility
   - Security and compliance (EULA review, certifications)
   - Governance and control (granular access, cost control)

4. **Cost and Performance Management**:
   - Cost tagging and management
   - Cross-region routing
   - Inference modes (on-demand, batch, provisioned throughput)

5. **Operational Excellence**:
   - Automation (prompt engineering, prompt management, flows)
   - Observability (CloudWatch integration, custom solution)

6. **Generative AI Platform Architecture**:
   - Centralized approach (single account, consistent governance)
   - Decentralized approach (encourages innovation, autonomy)
   - Hybrid approach (combines centralized governance and decentralized flexibility)

7. **Amazon Bedrock Features**:
   - Model access and onboarding
   - Cost tagging and management
   - Inference modes (on-demand, batch, provisioned throughput)
   - Prompt engineering and management
   - Flows (orchestration of components)
   - Observability (CloudWatch, custom solution)
   - Guardrails (content filtering, data protection)

## Key Insights

- Enterprises need a well-oiled pipeline for model approvals and onboarding due to the rapid model lifecycle in generative AI.
- Cost and performance management is crucial, achieved through cost tagging, cross-region routing, and a mix of inference modes.
- Automation and observability are essential for operational excellence in building enterprise-ready generative AI applications.
- A hybrid approach, combining centralized governance and decentralized flexibility, is recommended for scaling generative AI in large organizations.
- Amazon Bedrock provides a comprehensive set of features to address enterprise readiness, including compliance, cost management, automation, and observability.

## Important Conclusions

- Closing the enterprise readiness gap requires addressing compliance, governance, cost management, performance, and operational excellence.
- Amazon Bedrock aims to simplify the journey to building enterprise-ready generative AI applications by offering a range of features and services.
- A hybrid architecture that balances centralized governance and decentralized flexibility is the recommended approach for scaling generative AI in large enterprises.
- Automation, observability, and cost optimization are critical components for operational excellence and cost-effective deployment of generative AI workloads.
