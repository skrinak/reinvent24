# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Warehouse Automation with Cutting-Edge Supply Chain Solutions (PRO205)

## Introduction

- Presenters: Eldon Travers (Principal Consultant, ProServ Expert Services), Unnati Joshi (Senior Program Manager, Global Engineering Services), and Cory Jines (AWS Cloud Delivery Architect)
- The session covers AWS and Amazon's solutions and technologies for warehouse automation and optimization, known as the Warehouse Automation and Optimization (WAO) program.

## Overview of the WAO Program

- The WAO program is designed to help customers transform their supply chain and warehousing operations to an Amazon-like model.
- It consists of four modules: Assessment, Design and Simulation, Systems and Data Synchronization, and Intelligence.
- The program leverages resources and expertise from AWS, Amazon.com, and partner companies.
- The five-step approach includes Assessment, Design and Simulation, System Synchronization, Data Strategy, and WAO Intelligence.

## Assessment Module

- A four-week process where experts assess the customer's supply chain and identify viable use cases.
- Involves documenting processes, material flows, data flows, and integrations.
- Builds a business justification, prioritizes use cases, and creates a transformation roadmap.
- Potential business benefits include increased throughput, labor reduction, quality improvement, and cost optimization.

## Design and Simulation Module

### Survey and Modeling (Unnati Joshi)

- Captures the existing physical facility using photogrammetry and 3D scanning techniques.
- Utilizes technologies like LIDAR scanners and NavVis VLX 3 to create accurate point cloud models.
- Asset tagging and modeling incorporate detailed information about building elements, material handling equipment, and associate-facing elements.
- The resulting Building Information Model (BIM) is data-enabled and interoperable with various file formats.
- Serves as a handoff point for future state design and simulation.

### Design, Simulate, and Analyze (Cory Jines)

- Focuses on understanding the customer's objectives (e.g., increasing throughput and capacity).
- Educates customers on available innovations, such as robotics, AGVs, and goods-to-person solutions.
- Simulates the future state using digital twin technology and partners like BigBear.ai's ProModel.
- Allows for data-driven decision-making by measuring and comparing current and simulated metrics.
- Operationalizes the solution through change management, addressing people, processes, technology, policies, and metrics.
- Partners with Spinnaker SCA for capacity planning, material flow analysis, and operational simulation.

## Systems and Data Synchronization

- Integrates the customer's existing applications (ERP, WMS, TMS) into the solution.
- Establishes a connected data strategy on AWS, enabling data synchronization and reporting.

## WAO Intelligence Module

- Leverages technologies like machine learning, AI, computer vision, and document digitization.
- Optimizes operations through data synchronization, analytics, visibility, and generative AI (gen AI) for document processing.

## Conclusion

- The session provided a comprehensive overview of the WAO program, covering the assessment, design, simulation, data synchronization, and intelligence modules.
- It highlighted AWS and Amazon's solutions, partner collaborations, and real-world examples of warehouse automation and optimization.
- Attendees were encouraged to visit the AWS Village or Publicis Sapient booth for further information and discussions.
