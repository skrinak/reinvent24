# Summary: Emotionally Intelligent Leadership for an AI-Powered Future

## Introduction

- Rich Hua and Alla Simoneau discuss the importance of emotional intelligence (EQ) and social skills for leaders in an AI-powered future.
- The EPIC (Empathy, Purpose, Inspiration, Connection) Leadership Program aims to upskill leaders in emotional and social intelligence.

## State of the World in AI

- We live in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) times with rapid technological change.
- Leaders face fear, uncertainty, doubt (FUD), and fear of missing out (FOMO) around AI, but also opportunities (FOTO, FOLO).
- AI is accelerating faster than ever before, exceeding human capabilities in many areas.
- The nature of work is changing, and people-oriented skills like empathy, problem-solving, and collaboration will be crucial.

## EPIC Leadership Evolution

- Technical leaders need to evolve beyond technical solutions to human-centered ones.
- Emotional intelligence helps manage stress, make good decisions, and inspire people.
- Leaders must operate in the zone of maximum cognitive efficiency, balancing stress levels.
- Emotionally intelligent leadership, as exemplified by Ernest Shackleton, involves positivity, adaptability, empathy, and communication.

## Optimizing Yourself for Innovation

- Regulate stress through positivity, connection with friends, and mindful breathing exercises.
- Embrace an adaptable mindset (growth mindset, beginner's mindset) that views challenges as opportunities.
- Reframe situations through reinterpretation, repositioning, reordering, and normalization.

## Optimizing Your Organization for Innovation

- Psychological safety, where people feel safe to take interpersonal risks, is crucial for team innovation and performance.
- Build trust by demonstrating care, positive relationships, consistency, and competence.
- Encourage intelligent failures and experimentation through a "two-way door" approach.
- Promote generative disagreement and healthy debate to produce better ideas and decisions.
- Foster a culture of candor, cognitive friction, and intellectual honesty (the "innovation edge").

## Conclusion

- Embrace change and uncertainty in this new era of leadership.
- Leverage emotional intelligence skills to maximize success in an AI-powered future.
- Resources and further sessions on EPIC Leadership and Innovation are available.
