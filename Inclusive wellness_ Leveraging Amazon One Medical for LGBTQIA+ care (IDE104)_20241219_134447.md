# Inclusive Wellness: Leveraging Amazon One Medical for LGBTQIA+ Care

## Overview

This panel discussion focused on the importance of inclusive healthcare for the LGBTQIA+ community and how Amazon One Medical is addressing this need through its culturally competent care model. The panelists shared insights on the current state of LGBTQIA+ healthcare access, challenges faced by LGBTQIA+ patients, and the role of technology in improving healthcare delivery and accessibility.

## Key Points

### Current State of LGBTQIA+ Healthcare Access

- LGBTQIA+ communities are rapidly growing and represent a significant demographic with notable spending power in the United States.
- Younger generations, such as Gen Z, have a higher percentage of individuals identifying as LGBTQIA+, highlighting the increasing importance of inclusive healthcare.
- Over 90% of LGBTQIA+ individuals and 80% of allies say they will not buy products and services that are not intentionally LGBTQIA+ inclusive.

### Challenges and Solutions

- Access to queer health and preventative healthcare is limited in many states, making it difficult for LGBTQIA+ individuals to find affirming and competent care providers.
- One Medical addresses this challenge through its nationwide virtual care model, allowing patients to access care from LGBTQIA+ affirming providers regardless of location.
- Mental health is a significant concern for the LGBTQIA+ community, with higher rates of depression and substance use disorders. One Medical's Mindset program provides integrated mental health services with clinical psychologists and psychiatric consultants.

### Role of Technology

- One Medical has integrated various AI-powered tools, such as Smart Draft Messaging, Document Summary, and Health Scribe, to improve efficiency and reduce administrative burdens for providers, allowing them to spend more time with patients.
- Cultural competency training platforms like Violet offer educational modules and analytics to upskill providers and measure their competency in caring for diverse populations.
- Panelists envision future innovations that leverage AI to personalize healthcare journeys, automate tasks, and provide tailored recommendations based on individual needs and available resources.

## Important Conclusions

- Inclusive healthcare is not only a matter of equity but also a business imperative, as the LGBTQIA+ community represents a rapidly growing and influential consumer segment.
- One Medical's culturally competent care model, combined with its nationwide virtual care and integrated mental health services, addresses the unique needs of LGBTQIA+ patients.
- The integration of AI and technology in healthcare has the potential to improve efficiency, accessibility, and personalization, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and experiences for LGBTQIA+ patients.
- Healthcare companies and businesses should prioritize inclusion as a core value, recognizing its benefits for both patients and business success.
