# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Assessing climate risk with spatial analysis on AWS (SUS305).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Spatial Analysis and Climate Risk Assessment**
   - Spatial analysis refers to understanding events and characterizing the what and why they happen based on location or space.
   - Climate risk analysis helps organizations identify current and future potential risks in the surrounding natural environment.
   - Tokio Marine Highlands combines spatial analysis and climate risk analysis to improve risk models for customers.

2. **Increasing Extreme Weather Events and Economic Burden**
   - There has been a threefold increase in the number of assets lost due to extreme weather events since 2000.
   - The loss of physical assets in the US alone has topped $100 billion annually in recent years.
   - The total economic burden due to severe weather events is approximately 1-2% of US GDP.

3. **Tokio Marine Highlands' Use Cases**
   - Refining underwriting processes using spatial analytics.
   - Tracking storms live and in real-time to respond to policyholders.
   - Managing portfolio and tail risk, looking for aggregate concentration.

4. **Modernizing GEOspatial Technology Stack**
   - Organizations need to modernize their GEOspatial technology stack to support advanced use cases.
   - Carto, an AWS partner, provides a cloud-native spatial analytics platform to support customers like Tokio Marine Highlands.
   - Carto extends the capabilities of AWS analytics engines (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Amazon SageMaker) to perform spatial analytics at scale.

5. **Benefits of Cloud-Native Spatial Analytics**
   - Combining GEOspatial data with other data sources for enrichment and real-time analysis.
   - Performing spatial analytics directly on AWS analytics engines without extracting data to a separate system.
   - Utilizing AI agents to interact with maps and perform spatial analysis through natural language queries.

## Key Insights

- Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and severity, leading to a significant economic burden on society.
- Tokio Marine Highlands leverages spatial analytics and climate risk analysis to improve insurance underwriting and risk management.
- Modernizing the GEOspatial technology stack by moving to a cloud-native architecture enables advanced spatial analytics capabilities at scale.
- Carto, in partnership with AWS, provides a platform for integrating spatial data with other data sources and performing spatial analysis directly on AWS analytics engines.
- AI agents can democratize spatial analytics by enabling natural language interaction with maps and performing spatial analysis through queries.

## Important Conclusions

- Addressing the increasing risks posed by extreme weather events requires advanced spatial analytics and climate risk assessment capabilities.
- Adopting a cloud-native architecture for spatial analytics, as demonstrated by Tokio Marine Highlands and Carto, enables organizations to leverage the scalability and integration capabilities of AWS analytics services.
- Combining spatial data with other data sources, real-time updates, and AI-powered interactions can unlock new insights and improve decision-making processes related to climate risk and natural disasters.
- Partnerships between organizations like Tokio Marine Highlands, Carto, and AWS are crucial in driving innovation and providing comprehensive solutions for spatial analytics and climate risk assessment.
