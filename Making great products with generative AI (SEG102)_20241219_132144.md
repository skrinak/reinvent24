# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Making Great Products with Generative AI

## Summary

### Introduction

- Jeffrey Hammond, Head of Worldwide ISV Product Management Transformation at AWS, discusses how software companies are using generative AI as part of their product strategy.
- Suraj Krishnan, Group VP of Engineering Telemetry Data Platform at New Relic, shares their journey of using generative AI internally and in their products.

### Generative AI Use Cases

#### Optimization Journeys (Operational Improvement)

- Companies often start with optimization use cases focused on internal operational improvement, such as:
  - Customer self-service
  - Revenue operations
  - Marketing content generation
  - Lead development operations
  - Software product delivery

#### Product Differentiation and Growth

- More strategic use cases involve embedding generative AI in the products companies sell:
  - Investing in differentiation
  - Generating additional growth through new products (chatbots, co-pilots)
  - Streamlining user experience and reducing toil
  - Improving automation
  - Summarizing operational data and lighting up dark data

### Examples of Generative AI in Products

- **Appian**: Infused generative AI capabilities into their semantic search, using customer data to create a robust hybrid search experience.
- **Alida**: Rapidly summarizes customer comments and feedback, providing insights to product managers.
- **SnapLogic**: Generates and consumes executable artifacts (pipelines) using their data model.
- **Greenhouse**: Leverages generative AI for job postings, interview questions, resume analysis, DEI outcomes, Q&A, and scheduling automation.

### Embedding Generative AI in Products

- Companies can choose between an immersive approach (infusing generative AI into the hero product, like Canva) or a co-pilot approach (separate branded experience, like Salesforce Einstein or Xero's Just Ask Xero).
- Mastering data is crucial for differentiation, including collecting, cleaning, annotating, versioning, and establishing data lineage.

### Technical Skills and Approaches

- Essential skills: prompt engineering, critical thinking, turning data into value, process re-engineering, and change management.
- Center of Excellence model: A core team responsible for common services (LLMs, multi-model routing, data lakes) that are embedded into individual product teams.
- Design paradigms: Immersive (infusing generative AI into the hero product) or co-pilot (separate branded experience).
- Approaches: Prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning, and training custom models (with increasing complexity and cost).
- Balancing accuracy, cost, and speed is crucial for scaling generative experiences.

### Lessons Learned from New Relic

- Focused on proof of value, not just proof of concept.
- Measured the actual value generated by generative AI initiatives.
- Leveraged classical machine learning approaches where appropriate.
- Experimented and prototyped iteratively, scoping use cases appropriately.
- Explored cost-effective techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) before fine-tuning or training custom models.
- Emphasized the importance of context and domain knowledge.

### AWS Support and Resources

- AWS offers various products, tools, and programs to accelerate the generative AI journey for software companies, such as:
  - Low-level infrastructure for building custom models
  - Tools for building shared services and organizational capabilities
  - Higher-level use cases (Q Developer, QuickSight Q)
  - Generative AI Accelerator, Incubator, and self-paced labs

## Key Takeaways

- Software companies are embedding generative AI in their products to drive differentiation, growth, and streamlined user experiences.
- Mastering data and establishing a strong data foundation is crucial for successful generative AI product strategies.
- Balancing accuracy, cost, and speed is essential for scaling generative experiences.
- Iterative experimentation, prototyping, and a focus on high-value use cases are recommended approaches.
- AWS offers a range of resources and programs to support software companies in their generative AI journeys.
