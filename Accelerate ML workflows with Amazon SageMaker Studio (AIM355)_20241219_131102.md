# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Accelerate ML Workflows with Amazon SageMaker Studio (AIM355)

## Introduction

- Generative AI is transforming customer experience, productivity, and operational efficiency across industries.
- Organizations are accelerating investments in AI-enabled solutions built on multiple models, customizing them through techniques like fine-tuning.
- SageMaker Studio provides a unified interface for data scientists and developers to build end-to-end AI workflows.

## Key Features of SageMaker Studio

### Data Preparation

- Integrated with Amazon DataZone business data catalog for discovering and using high-quality datasets.
- Turbocharged Jupyter Notebooks with polyglot capabilities (SQL and Python in the same notebook).
- Connect notebooks to EMR Serverless for distributed Spark processing jobs.

### Model Selection and Customization

- JumpStart model hub with over 300 open-source and commercial foundation models.
- Automated and human-in-the-loop model evaluation for assessing model efficacy.
- Fine-tuning models using visual interface or SDK, with MLflow integration for experiment tracking.

### Model Deployment and Monitoring

- Deploy open-source models in two steps using SageMaker Python SDK and optimized runtime containers.
- Inference Optimization Toolkit for advanced techniques like speculative decoding and model quantization.
- SageMaker Pipelines for automating end-to-end workflows using SDK or visual designer.
- AI assistance powered by Amazon Q for inline code generation, explanation, and troubleshooting.

### Partner AI Apps

- Access industry-leading generative AI and ML development applications from AWS partners.
- Run partner apps privately and securely within the SageMaker development environment.
- Natively integrated with SageMaker Studio for seamless workflow.
- Partners include Comet (experiment management), Deepchecks (model evaluation), Fiddler (model observability), and Lakera (AI application firewall).

## SageMaker Unified Studio

- Brings together AI capabilities of SageMaker Studio with data analytics and generative AI tooling into a single interface.

## Demo: Fine-tuning LLM for Financial Analysts

- Use case: Fine-tune a language model to summarize financial risks from SEC filings for financial analysts.
- Steps:
  - Explored off-the-shelf Meta LLaMa model and its limitations.
  - Prepared data by downloading SEC filings and uploading to S3.
  - Fine-tuned the LLaMa model with different hyperparameters, tracking experiments with MLflow.
  - Deployed the fine-tuned model and compared its improved performance.
  - Evaluated the model at scale using automated evaluation and partner app Deepchecks.
  - Utilized Amazon Q for inline code explanation and assistance.
  - Automated the end-to-end workflow using SageMaker Pipelines visual designer.

## GoDaddy's AI Domain Search

- GoDaddy's mission is to empower entrepreneurs by providing relevant digital tools.
- GoDaddy Airo is a unified AI platform supporting identity, presence, and commerce.
- AI Domain Search provides personalized, data-driven domain name suggestions.
- Architecture leverages SageMaker for model training, development, and dataset preparation.
- Fine-tuned LLaMa model with GoDaddy's proprietary domain data for targeted suggestions.
- Incorporates real-time customer signals and preferences for personalization.
- Outperformed traditional deep learning models and improved customer engagement.
- Streamlined ML lifecycle using SageMaker Studio, MLflow, and other AWS services, achieving cost savings.
- Future plans include API deployment, faster generative AI features, high-volume data store, AutoML, and data lake integration.

## Key Takeaways

- Centralize tools in a platform like SageMaker Studio to drive innovation and streamline workflows.
- Efficient resource management through automation helps scale AI while keeping costs down.
- Encourage an open and experimental culture among teams to fuel innovation.
- Continuously iterate, adapt, and respond to changing customer needs as AI evolves.
