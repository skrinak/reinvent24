# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 -Enhancing software vendorsâ€™ gen AI features with the Amazon Q index (AIM280-NEW).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. Amazon Q has launched new features to help software vendors provide more enriching generative AI features to their end users.

2. The key challenges in building cross-app aware generative AI features include:
   - Lack of full context across applications
   - Integrating data from multiple apps while maintaining authorizations and privacy
   - Doing this at scale for millions of users with enterprise-grade security and compliance

3. Amazon Q Embedded allows software vendors to embed the Amazon Q experience (with customization) into their applications, providing a generative AI assistant for public data like documentation.

4. Amazon Q Index provides an API for software vendors to access cross-application data from Amazon Q's index, enabling them to generate more contextualized insights by combining their app data with data from other enterprise apps used by customers.

5. Amazon Q Index offers flexibility for software vendors to use their preferred large language models (LLMs) while leveraging Amazon Q's cross-app data indexing capabilities.

6. Software vendors can onboard customers in two ways:
   - Customers who already have an Amazon Q index can grant access to the software vendor.
   - Software vendors can build and manage the index on behalf of their customers.

7. Key benefits for software vendors include:
   - Top-line growth by onboarding all customers
   - Building new generative AI assistants or enriching existing AI experiences
   - Reduced overhead by leveraging Amazon Q's infrastructure and integrations
   - Maintaining enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- Amazon Q's new offerings aim to solve the challenges of building cross-app aware generative AI features by providing a managed solution for data integration, indexing, and retrieval, while allowing software vendors to maintain control over the user experience and LLM models.

- Software vendors can leverage Amazon Q's capabilities to create more engaging and productive experiences for their end users by providing contextualized insights from across the applications they use.

- The flexibility to onboard all customers, reduce development overhead, and maintain enterprise-grade security and compliance makes Amazon Q's offerings attractive for software vendors looking to enhance their generative AI features.

- Real-world examples from Zoom, Asana, and Miro demonstrate how software vendors are reimagining their applications by integrating Amazon Q's cross-app data capabilities.
