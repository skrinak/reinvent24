# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Reimagining IT: From Cost Center to Innovative Product Builder

## Introduction

- The session covered how Amazon innovates and its approach to product management, focusing on working backwards from the customer.
- Speakers: Ceileidh Siegel (Head of Americas, Innovation and Transformation Delivery), Ben Micheel (Innovation Transformation Programs), and Fatima Howes (VP of Product Design, Bridgestone).

## Amazon's Product Management Approach

### Key Principles

- Start with the customer and work backwards.
- Envision the world as products.
- Organize with cross-functional product teams (two-pizza teams).
- Reduce risk through iteration and experimentation.
- Own the entire product lifecycle.

### Working Backwards Process

- Answer the five customer questions before starting a new product:
  1. Who is the customer, and what insights do we have about them?
  2. What is the customer's pain point or need?
  3. What is the solution to address the need?
  4. How will the customer experience the solution?
  5. What is the customer's motivation to use the solution?
- Create a press release, FAQ, and visual mockup (PRFAQ) as the "world's cheapest prototype."
- Iterate and refine the PRFAQ based on feedback.

### Product Teams

- Small, cross-functional teams (5-8 people) focused on a specific customer experience.
- Composed of a product manager, UX designer, and relevant technical experts.
- Enable faster, higher-quality decisions and more experimentation.

### Benefits

- Accelerates time to know if an idea is valuable or not.
- Develops deep customer empathy and understanding.
- Enables data-driven decisions and scaling of successful products.
