# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Streamlining software development across Amazon_com with Amazon Q (AMZ202).txt

# Summary

## Introduction
- Kirankumar Chandrashekar (AWS) and Lilia Abaibourova (Prime Video Product Manager) presented on how Amazon is using AWS Q Developer to streamline software development across Amazon.com.
- Q Developer is an AI-powered service that assists developers with various tasks across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Importance of Speed in Amazon's SDLC
- Speed is crucial for Amazon's competitive edge, enabling rapid innovation and addressing customer needs quickly.
- Amazon continually refines its processes to maintain speed at scale while ensuring quality and efficiency.
- Challenges in accelerating SDLC include cross-functional coordination, infrastructure complexity, testing at scale, and balancing speed with governance.

## Q Developer's Role in Amazon's SDLC

### Planning Phase
- Q Developer is available on the AWS console, documentation, and IDEs, assisting with planning by providing guidance on services, infrastructure, and aligning business objectives.

### Create Phase
- Q acts as a coding companion in IDEs and CLI, offering code generation, intelligent suggestions, and conversational coding capabilities.
- It simplifies coding tasks, boosts productivity with automation, and provides customized recommendations based on Amazon's codebase.

### Test and Secure Phase
- Q generates comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and security scans, identifying vulnerabilities and providing remediation guidance.

### Operate Phase
- Q assists with troubleshooting errors, debugging, optimizing code, and right-sizing AWS resources directly from IDEs and the AWS console.

### Maintain and Modernize Phase
- Q Developer's code transformation agent helps upgrade languages, frameworks, and perform modernization tasks efficiently.

## Prime Video's Q Developer Adoption Journey
- Prime Video started with a pilot program, initially using Q for generating unit tests.
- As Q matured, its adoption expanded to cover more SDLC phases, including creation, testing, operation, and maintenance.
- Customization and context-aware features improved accuracy and suggestion acceptance rates.
- Developers reported productivity gains, increased development velocity, and the ability to spend more time in the "flow" due to reduced context switching.
- Q became an accelerator for learning, enabling developers to ask questions about Prime Video's services and components in natural language.

## JDK Migration with Q Developer
- Amazon strategically used Q Developer's code transformation capability to migrate tens of thousands of production applications from Java 8 to Java 17.
- This effort saved an estimated 4,500 years of development work and $260 million in annual cost savings due to performance improvements.
- Q Developer automated the migration process, eliminating the need for extensive manual research, code updates, and troubleshooting.
- Amazon saw significant performance improvements, including reduced CPU utilization, latency, and build times, after migrating to Java 17 with Q Developer.
