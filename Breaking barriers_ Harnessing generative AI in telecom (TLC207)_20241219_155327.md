# Summary

## Breaking Barriers: Harnessing Generative AI in Telecom

### Introduction

- AWS for Telecom works with telecom operators, customers, and partners across five continents to help transform telcos, reimagine consumer experiences, and digitize industries.
- The session focused on digital inclusion and how generative AI can be leveraged to build digitally inclusive applications.

### Vision and Mission

- The mission of AWS for Telecom is to evolve telco customers from companies that connect phones to world-class institutions underpinning the fabrics of daily lives.
- Despite technological progress, barriers remain in the adoption, consumption, and inclusive use of technology.
- The Breaking Barriers program aims to bring together multiple sectors to address these barriers and enable inclusive use of technology.

### Breaking Barriers Hackathon

- The Breaking Barriers Hackathon, held in partnership with NVIDIA, Anthropic, and AT&T, showcased the potential of generative AI for digital inclusion.
- Over 30 projects were developed in just 72 hours, with the winning application being LearnAI, an education learning app that adapts to the user's learning style.

### LearnAI Application

- LearnAI is an application that tailors the learning experience to the user's preferred learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).
- It dynamically renders games and explanations based on the user's learning needs and the uploaded document.
- The application demonstrates the power of generative AI in creating personalized and inclusive learning experiences.

### Technical Foundations

- The session covered the technical foundations for building generative AI applications, including:
  - Compute and AI Foundation (Amazon Bedrock, Trainium, Inferentia)
  - Tools (Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q)
  - Generative AI Gateway (API Gateway pattern, model abstraction layer, playground interface)
  - Data Foundation (Amazon DataZone)

### Scaling and Next Steps

- The session emphasized the importance of scaling these digitally inclusive applications globally.
- AWS for Telecom plans to work with telco providers and partners to build a telco data foundation and a web of models and data producers/consumers.
- Attendees were encouraged to experiment with the open-source assets and collaborate with AWS for Telecom to build inclusive and scalable solutions.

Overall, the session highlighted AWS for Telecom's commitment to digital inclusion and demonstrated how generative AI can be harnessed to break barriers and enable inclusive access to technology for all.
