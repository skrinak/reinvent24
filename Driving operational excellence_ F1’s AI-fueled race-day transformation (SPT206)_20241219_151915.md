# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Driving operational excellence: F1's AI-fueled race-day transformation

## Summary

### Introduction

- The presentation discusses how AWS and Formula 1 (F1) have collaborated to drive innovation and continuous experimentation within F1's operations.
- The key goals were to accelerate F1's transformation into the cloud, bring a new era of innovation to the entire sport, and create a blueprint for continuous innovation that other organizations can emulate.

### Priorities for Innovation

- Embrace the possibility of failure and ensure that the experimentation and learning cycle is not left to chance.
- Ensure that teams can act decisively and independently.
- Create velocity and experimentation, with faster iterations and insights.

### Mechanisms for Innovation

- **Working Backwards Approach**: Creating a written narrative (fictional press release and FAQs) to gather feedback early, iterate on initiatives, and get ready to run fast once ready.
- **Two-Pizza Teams**: Organizing in small, nimble teams with autonomous decision-making to reduce communication overhead and create more capacity for experimentation.
- **Single-Threaded Ownership**: Having one business leader responsible for pushing progress forward, aligning resources, and removing obstacles.
- **One-Way and Two-Way Door Decisions**: Balancing speed and quality of decisions, with one-way door decisions requiring more alignment and debate, and two-way door decisions allowing for faster iterations and reversibility.

### F1's Innovation Journey

- F1 recognized the need for experimentation and innovation to remain relevant and competitive.
- Innovations like the on-board camera and helmet cam were introduced through experimentation.
- F1 shifted from a steering committee model to a single-threaded ownership model, enabling faster decision-making and innovation.

### Key Innovations

1. **Track Pulse**
   - Leverages telemetry and positioning data to identify and highlight stories and insights for the production team.
   - Combines real-time action with historical data to deliver engaging insights to fans.

2. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Chatbot**
   - Assists F1 engineers in troubleshooting and resolving issues during race days.
   - Mimics the steps an engineer would take, reducing resolution time by 86%.
   - Democratizes issue resolution and escalates to the right team with relevant logs and context.

### Culture of Experimentation

- Break down the business problem into small, time-bound experiments.
- Embrace failure as a learning opportunity and incorporate lessons into the next experiment.
- Celebrate and scale successful experiments across the organization.
- Continuously iterate and incorporate feedback to improve.

### Conclusion

- The collaboration between AWS and F1 has enabled continuous innovation and operational excellence through a culture of experimentation.
- The key is to focus on business impact, embrace failure, and scale successful experiments across the organization.
