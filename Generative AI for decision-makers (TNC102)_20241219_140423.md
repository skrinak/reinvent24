# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Generative AI for Decision Makers

## Introduction to Generative AI

- Generative AI (Gen AI) has been a buzzword for the past year or so. It utilizes neural networks and machine learning to interpret large amounts of unlabeled data and generate valuable information, such as content summaries, code, conversations, imagery, and more.
- While machine learning models make predictions based on labeled data, Gen AI models can learn patterns and context from unlabeled data through a process called pre-training.
- The pre-trained model, known as a foundation model, represents what the machine has learned from the massive corpus of data it was exposed to.

## Use Cases and Applications

- Gen AI can be applied to various use cases, including:
    - Creativity and content generation (e.g., product descriptions, imagery)
    - Productivity (e.g., coding assistance with Amazon Q Developer)
    - Customer experience (e.g., conversational chatbots)
    - Business processes (e.g., content summarization, workflow optimization)

- Potential applications span multiple industries:
    - Healthcare (e.g., medical imagery analysis)
    - Financial services (e.g., empathetic debt collection notices)
    - Manufacturing (e.g., process optimization)
    - Retail (e.g., virtual try-ons)
    - Media and entertainment (content monetization, metadata generation)

## Technical Fundamentals

- Foundation models are pre-trained on massive amounts of general domain data, a process that can take months with significant compute power.
- Prompts are inputs provided to the Gen AI model, which are divided into tokens (roughly every six characters) for the model to interpret.
- The model uses a decoder to predict the probability of the next token based on the input, generating context and conversations.
- Techniques like fine-tuning (adding a layer to the foundation model) and prompt engineering (optimizing the input prompts) can improve the model's performance for specific use cases.

## Implementing Generative AI Projects

- Define the scope: Understand the business value, customer needs, and feasibility before embarking on a Gen AI project.
- Select the model: Choose an appropriate foundation model and consider fine-tuning it for your specific use case.
- Adapt the model: Optimize prompts (prompt engineering) and fine-tune the model to align with your requirements.
- Use the model: Deploy the model and gather feedback for continuous improvement.

## Responsible AI

- Ensure fairness and equity in the model's outputs, as unconscious bias can be introduced through the training data.
- Maintain privacy and security by anonymizing personal data and implementing appropriate safeguards.
- Identify and mitigate risks, such as hallucinations (mistakes), toxicity, plagiarism, and disruptions to the nature of work.
- Implement governance models, transparency, and ethical standards to ensure responsible use of AI models.

## CANAL+ Group's Journey with Generative AI

- As a large, established media company with legacy systems and challenges, CANAL+ Group took a strategic approach to adopting Gen AI.
- They created an AI factory and trained 350 employees on AWS courses and certifications to build internal expertise.
- Concrete use cases include:
    - Gender equality analysis in movies and TV shows
    - Multilingual chatbot for customer support across 52 countries
    - Content intelligence and metadata generation for monetization opportunities
- The key challenges were managing costs, cybersecurity, and integrating Gen AI into existing production environments.
- CANAL+ Group focused on finding clear business cases, conducting proofs of concept, and ensuring a positive return on investment before scaling Gen AI applications.

## Organizational Readiness

- Secure leadership buy-in and communicate a shared vision for adopting Gen AI.
- Train employees and introduce Gen AI tools as productivity helpers, not job replacements.
- Highlight the benefits, celebrate wins, and gather employee feedback throughout the adoption process.
- Coordinate with experts, ensure data quality and availability, and implement a governance model for responsible AI use.

## Call to Action

- Experiment with Gen AI and build business cases to understand its potential value.
- Develop a long-term strategy for integrating Gen AI into your organization.
- Start thinking about Gen AI as a new tool to enhance productivity and decision-making.
