# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Data Foundation in the Age of Generative AI (ANT302)

## Introduction

- The session covers how AWS is scaling and evolving its data foundation capabilities to meet the demands of building generative AI applications.
- It discusses the impact of generative AI on data engineering and the importance of data for generative AI.

## Understanding Data Foundation

- Data foundation is an organizational strategy centered around ingestion, integration, processing, transformation, and governance of data.
- It is for employees, partners, and customers to enable data-driven decision-making.
- AWS delivers data foundation through a comprehensive set of data, machine learning, and AI services with native integration capabilities and comprehensive data governance.
- Benefits of data foundation include:
  - Business benefits: Efficiently organizing quality data, making it easier to trust and monetize, ability to quickly adopt new frameworks like data mesh and generative AI.
  - Technology benefits: Findability, accessibility, better interoperability, and increased reusability.

## Scaling Data Foundation Capabilities for Generative AI

### Unstructured Data Processing

- Generative AI introduces the need for additional unstructured data sources.
- AWS AI services like Amazon Comprehend, Transcribe, Textract, and SageMaker can extract metadata from unstructured data.
- The extracted metadata can be stored in a metadata catalog for discovery and access control.

### Data Integration and Processing

- Generative AI applications require advanced forms of data integration and data stores.
- AWS services like Amazon Bedrock, OpenSearch, and managed databases (Aurora, DocumentDB, Neptune) support vector data management for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach.

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

- Some generative AI applications incorporate RLHF for personalized and accurate responses.
- Customer 360 data warehouses (Amazon Redshift) and conversation history databases (Amazon DynamoDB) can provide user personalization context.

### Data Governance

- Data sharing, data privacy, data quality, and data cataloging play an important role in comprehensive data governance for generative AI applications.
- AWS services like Redshift, Lake Formation, AWS Data Exchange, and DataZone enable secure data sharing and governance.
- AWS Glue can detect and process sensitive data (PII) and monitor data quality issues.

## Real-World Use Case: Amazon Finance

- Amazon Finance built a data mesh foundation on AWS to create a single source of truth, make data accessible and discoverable, and ensure robust data security and governance.
- They integrated data from hundreds of systems into the data mesh and enabled self-service data sharing.
- Benefits included improved business agility, faster time to make data valuable, better performance, and cost savings.
- To enhance the data mesh with generative AI features, they:
  - Utilized AWS vector data store (OpenSearch) to extract context from unstructured policy documents.
  - Built a RAG pipeline to search and retrieve policy information based on analyst prompts.
  - Integrated financial data from the data mesh to provide specific recommendations for resolving customer requests.
- Initial results showed improved productivity, accelerated time to understand context and get answers, and elevated customer experience.
- Future plans include onboarding more domains, stronger data discovery and governance, and cost optimization opportunities with zero-ETL.

## Evolution of AWS Data Foundation Capabilities

- AWS announced the next generation of Amazon SageMaker, which is becoming the center of data analytics and AI on AWS.
- Key components:
  - SageMaker Unified Studio: A unified IDE for developing data processing applications, SQL analytics, model development, and generative AI applications.
  - SageMaker Data and AI Governance: Easy-to-use and powerful capabilities powered by DataZone and Q.
  - SageMaker Lakehouse: A unified data management layer that allows managing and accessing data from Redshift managed storage, open file formats, and S3 Tables.
- SageMaker Lakehouse:
  - Offers a unified technical catalog with Redshift managed storage, open file formats in S3, S3 Tables, and federated sources.
  - Provides open access through the Apache Iceberg REST API for 1P and 3P services.
  - Offers secure access with fine-grained access controls.
  - Supports easy data ingestion with zero-ETL capabilities from various sources, including enterprise applications.
  - Supports streaming ingestion from Kinesis Data Streams, managed Kafka, Apache Kafka, and Confluent.
  - Provides a unified business catalog with cube-based dataset discovery and Git-based collaboration.
- SageMaker Unified Studio:
  - A single data and AI development environment for creating applications, data preparation, SQL queries, and generative AI development.
  - Integrates with existing EMR, Glue, and Redshift endpoints.
  - Accelerated with Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI assistant for software development.

The session highlights AWS's efforts to evolve its data foundation capabilities to meet the demands of generative AI applications, with a focus on unstructured data processing, data integration, data governance, and a unified development experience through the next generation of Amazon SageMaker.
