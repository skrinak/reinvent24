# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Responsible AI with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails

## Summary

### Introduction to Responsible AI
- Responsible AI is the practice of designing, developing, and using AI technology to maximize benefit and minimize risk.
- AWS has identified eight dimensions of Responsible AI:
  - Controllability
  - Privacy and Security
  - Safety
  - Fairness
  - Veracity and Robustness
  - Explainability
  - Transparency
  - Governance

### Potential Problems without Responsible AI
- The speaker presented a scenario where a clothing brand owner, Sarah, wants to incorporate a chatbot on her website to handle customer queries.
- Without Responsible AI guardrails, the chatbot may:
  - Disclose proprietary information
  - Provide inconsistent brand voice or messaging
  - Violate regulatory compliance
  - Hallucinate or give unrelated responses

### Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
- Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is a feature that allows implementing application-specific safeguards based on Responsible AI policies.
- Key features of Bedrock Guardrails:
  - **Prompt Attacks**: Filters out attempts to override system instructions
  - **Profanity Filter**: Blocks profane words
  - **Harmful Categories**: Detects and blocks hate, insults, sexual content, violence, and misconduct
  - **Sensitive Information Filter**: Blocks or masks sensitive information like addresses, credit card numbers, etc.
  - **Denied Topics**: Allows defining specific topics that should not be answered

### Benefits of Bedrock Guardrails
- With Bedrock Guardrails in place, Sarah's chatbot:
  - Denies responses to off-topic or sensitive queries
  - Provides customized responses for denied topics
  - Continues to answer relevant queries appropriately
- Guardrails protect the company's brand, ecosystem, and customer trust while keeping conversations on track.

### Conclusion
- Practicing Responsible AI is good for business and aligns the AI system with the company's values and goals.
- Responsible AI is an iterative process, not a one-time implementation.
