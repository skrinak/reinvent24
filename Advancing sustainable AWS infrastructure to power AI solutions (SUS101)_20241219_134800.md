# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Advancing Sustainable AWS Infrastructure to Power AI Solutions

## Summary

### AWS's Sustainable Infrastructure at Scale

- AWS has a massive global infrastructure spanning 108 Availability Zones across 34 geographic regions and 245 countries/territories, with plans for further expansion.
- AWS co-founded the Climate Pledge in 2019, setting a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.
- AWS met its goal of matching 100% of its global energy consumption with renewable energy by 2023, 7 years ahead of the 2030 target.
- AWS is 41% towards its ambitious water positive goal by 2030, with 21 projects returning up to 7 billion liters of water annually.
- AWS is exploring all viable forms of carbon-free energy, including investments in small modular nuclear reactor projects, to transition to a carbon-free energy future.

### Innovations in Sustainable Infrastructure

- AWS applies circular economy principles (design better, operate longer, recover more) to decouple growth from finite resource consumption.
- AWS data centers have a global Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.15, with the best site in Europe achieving a PUE of 1.04, outperforming industry estimates.
- New data center components are projected to reduce AWS's carbon intensity by 14% and mechanical energy consumption by up to 46% during peak cooling conditions.
- AWS design standards now require concrete with up to 35% reduction in embodied carbon compared to standard concrete for US data centers.

### AI and Sustainable Infrastructure

- AI has become increasingly prevalent in everyday conversations and applications, including sustainability solutions.
- AWS has invested in designing custom silicon chips optimized for the cloud, improving power efficiency across workloads.
- AWS Inferentia, Graviton, and Trainium chips offer significant energy efficiency improvements for AI workloads.
- Customers like Amazon.com have deployed thousands of AWS AI chips for Prime Day, reducing energy consumption.
- The Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle transitioned to Flex Zero, a sustainability SaaS platform built on AWS, to accelerate sustainable operations through advanced automation, data management, and generative AI.

### Nasdaq's Sustainable Lens on AWS

- Nasdaq built the Sustainable Lens solution on AWS to help customers overcome challenges related to sustainability reporting and large amounts of data.
- Sustainable Lens collects sustainability content and financial filings from over 9,000 companies globally, as well as regulatory information.
- It uses AI and software workflows to process millions of sustainability metrics and extract information from billions of words, enabling peer research, regulatory readiness assessments, and disclosure drafting.
- Sustainable Lens leverages AWS services like Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, Batch, S3, EC2, and Lambda, enabling secure scale and responsible AI.
- Customers have reported 97% faster response times and significant cost savings using Sustainable Lens compared to manual research.

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- AWS is committed to sustainability and has made significant progress towards its net-zero carbon and renewable energy goals, while innovating in sustainable infrastructure design and operations.
- AWS's global infrastructure and custom silicon chips are optimized to support AI workloads more efficiently, enabling customers to pursue sustainability goals while deploying advanced AI solutions.
- Generative AI and solutions like Nasdaq's Sustainable Lens, built on AWS, are helping customers automate sustainability research, reporting, and regulatory compliance tasks, saving time and resources.
- Partnerships between AWS and customers like Nasdaq showcase the potential for leveraging cloud infrastructure and AI to drive sustainable outcomes and address pressing climate challenges.
