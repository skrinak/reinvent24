# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Grupo Boticário's AI-accessibility journey for inclusive e-commerce

## Overview

This session focused on Grupo Boticário's journey towards creating an inclusive e-commerce experience using generative AI, specifically targeting customers with disabilities. The key points and insights are as follows:

## Why Inclusion Matters

- Approximately 16% of the world's population (1.3 billion people) experience some form of significant disability.
- Inclusivity is crucial for businesses, as exclusion can lead to lost customers and negative word-of-mouth, especially among younger generations.
- Different groups, including those with disabilities, want to feel welcomed, valued, and invited in their customer journeys.

## The Power of Generative AI

- Generative AI enables scalability and personalization, allowing businesses to create individualized experiences for customers.
- AWS Bedrock provides a range of generative AI models and services that can be integrated into applications and platforms.
- Security, data privacy, and compliance are key considerations when using generative AI, and AWS ensures encrypted transactions, data residency, and third-party compliance certifications.

## Grupo Boticário's Inclusive Initiatives

- Grupo Boticário is a leading Brazilian beauty and retail company with a focus on diversity and inclusion.
- They have launched several products and accessories designed to assist people with disabilities, such as adaptive makeup brushes and a smart lipstick that helps with precise application for those with visual or upper limb impairments.
- The company aims to have 60% of its product portfolio incorporate diversity and inclusion elements by 2030.

## Inclusive E-commerce with AWS Bedrock

- Grupo Boticário integrated AWS Bedrock with their e-commerce platform to generate descriptive alt-text for product images, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired customers.
- The process involves sending product images to Bedrock's generative AI models (e.g., Anthropic Claude 3.5), which generate detailed descriptions of the images.
- These descriptions are then displayed as alt-text on the e-commerce website, providing a rich and inclusive experience for all customers.
- Additional benefits include improved internal search capabilities based on physical product characteristics and potential SEO improvements due to the increased text content.

## Key Takeaways

- Inclusivity is not only a social responsibility but also a business imperative, as it can attract and retain customers from diverse backgrounds.
- Generative AI technologies, such as AWS Bedrock, enable scalable and personalized inclusive experiences, particularly in digital environments like e-commerce.
- Grupo Boticário's initiatives demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity, leveraging AI to create accessible products and enhance the online shopping experience for customers with disabilities.
- While challenges remain, companies like Grupo Boticário are paving the way for more inclusive and accessible experiences through the innovative use of AI technologies.
