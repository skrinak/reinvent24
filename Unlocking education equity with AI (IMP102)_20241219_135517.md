# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Unlocking education equity with AI (IMP102).txt

# Summary

## Introduction

- The session focuses on how cloud technology, specifically AI, is unlocking education equity and learner agency.
- Aanya Niaz, the Global Lead for Education Equity at AWS, introduces the speakers: Karim Meghji (Chief Product Officer at Code.org) and Eric Rosenbaum (Director of Scratch Lab).

## Role of Cloud in Generating Social Impact

- Cloud technology has been instrumental in various sectors, including health, disaster response, and education.
- AWS supports organizations like Jacaranda Health, which helps pregnant women in Kenya access information and support.
- In education, AWS offers resources like Skill Builder, AWS AI&ML Scholarship, and Amazon Future Engineer to promote computer science and AI education.

## Code.org: AI Teaching Assistant

- Code.org is a nonprofit organization that aims to bring computer science education to students worldwide.
- They have developed an AI Teaching Assistant that helps teachers assess student coding projects and provide feedback.
- The AI Teaching Assistant uses AWS services like Bedrock, Claude, and Comprehend to analyze student code, compare it against rubrics, and suggest scores and feedback.
- The tool saves teachers' time, boosts their confidence in grading, and helps reduce bias.
- Code.org is also working on using AI for differentiation, tailoring lessons and activities based on individual student needs and motivations.

## Scratch: Unlocking Learner Agency with AI

- Scratch is an online creative coding community for kids, allowing them to create and share interactive projects.
- Scratch uses AWS services like Amazon Poly for text-to-speech and Amazon Translate for language translation, which are integrated into coding blocks.
- Scratch is exploring AI prototypes to explain code, provide coding assistance, and enable kids to build AI-powered applications using Scratch blocks.
- The focus is on putting the power of AI into the hands of kids while ensuring safety and creativity.

## Safety and Equity Considerations

- Safety is a critical consideration when introducing AI tools to learners and educators.
- Engaging users early, testing extensively, and using multiple models for filtering and processing are strategies discussed.
- Equity is addressed by ensuring access (online and offline), improving accessibility, and including diverse voices in the design process through collaborations and advisory boards.
- AI is seen as a potential tool to compress the gap in learning outcomes and engage underrepresented groups like girls in computer science education.

## Conclusion

- The session highlights how AWS, Code.org, and Scratch are leveraging cloud technology and AI to promote education equity, unlock learner agency, and inspire the next generation of creators and innovators.
- While challenges remain, the organizations are committed to a journey of responsible AI development, prioritizing safety, accessibility, and inclusivity.
