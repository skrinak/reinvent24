# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Build large-scale transactional data lakes with open table formats

## Summary

### Introduction
- Transactional Data Lakes are becoming increasingly important to support modern data use cases like streaming ingestion, compliance with data privacy regulations, and new applications like Generative AI.
- Open Table Formats (OTFs) like Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, and Delta Lake provide database-like capabilities for Data Lakes, enabling transactional updates, schema evolution, and other features.

### History and Evolution of Data Lakes
- Relational databases were foundational for transactions but lacked support for complex analytics.
- Data warehouses addressed this but were hard to scale due to their reliance on RDBMS.
- Hadoop and Data Lakes emerged, enabling decoupling of storage and compute, and supporting diverse data types.
- However, Data Lakes lacked consistency, integrity, and governance capabilities of data warehouses.
- The advent of the cloud and object storage led to the development of Lakehouse architectures, combining the benefits of Data Lakes and data warehouses.

### Open Table Formats (OTFs)
- OTFs like Apache Iceberg provide record-level updates, data integrity, fine-grained access control, schema evolution, and performance optimizations.
- Iceberg supports both Copy-on-Write and Merge-on-Read operations, allowing for efficient updates and inserts.
- Iceberg enables schema evolution and partition evolution without data movement or downtime.
- It also provides features like time travel, branching, and hidden partitioning for improved performance and data integrity.

### AWS Optimizations for Transactional Data Lakes
- AWS is continuously optimizing performance for Spark and OTFs, with the latest EMR 7.5 release being up to 3.6x faster than Apache Spark for Iceberg workloads.
- AWS supports fine-grained access control with OTFs through S3 Access Grants and Lake Formation integration.
- Glue Data Catalog supports multi-dialect views, multi-catalog support, automated compaction, and metadata federation for OTFs.
- SageMaker Lakehouse provides a unified data access layer for RMS tables, S3 data, and OTFs, with integrated fine-grained access control.
- AWS services like Kinesis Data Firehose now support writing to Iceberg tables.
- Projects like XTable and Delta Uniform aim to provide interoperability between OTFs.

### Key Takeaways
- AWS provides a comprehensive set of services and optimizations for building and managing transactional Data Lakes with OTFs.
- OTFs enable database-like features for Data Lakes, including transactional updates, schema evolution, and performance optimizations.
- AWS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, security, and vendor-neutral solutions for transactional Data Lakes.

## Conclusion
The session provided a detailed overview of transactional Data Lakes and the role of Open Table Formats in enabling database-like capabilities for Data Lakes. It highlighted the features and benefits of OTFs like Apache Iceberg and discussed AWS's optimizations and service integrations to support large-scale transactional Data Lakes. The key takeaway is that AWS offers a comprehensive and optimized platform for building and managing transactional Data Lakes with OTFs, enabling organizations to leverage the benefits of both Data Lakes and data warehouses.
