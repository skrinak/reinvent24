# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Unleashing Yanolja's Growth with Customer-Centric Transformation

## Introduction

- Terry from AWS Innovation and Transformation Programs explains Amazon's innovation mechanisms and how AWS supported Yanolja's transformation journey.
- Jeff Kim, CEO of Yanolja Cloud, discusses the innovation and evolution in the travel tech industry led by Yanolja.
- Akhila, Enterprise Transformation Leader at AWS, introduces key transformation insights.

## Amazon's Innovation Mechanisms

### Key Strategies for Managing Uncertainty

1. **Future-proofing the business**: 76% of CEOs anticipate their current business model will be unrecognizable in five years.
2. **Urgent upskilling**: Upskilling across business, product, and technology teams in AI, data analytics, and software development.
3. **Innovating at speed**: Leveraging cloud technology for rapid experimentation and responding to changes quickly.

### Amazon's Customer-Centric Innovation Process

- **Working Backwards Mechanism**: Creating a press release and FAQs at the initial planning stage, imagining the product at its launch.
- **Continuous Experimentation**: Validating customer problems, ideating solutions, and enhancing customer experiences through iterative experiments.

## Yanolja's Transformation Journey

### Addressing Data Fragmentation in the Travel Industry

- Yanolja developed three original business models to address data fragmentation and lack of personalization:
  1. **Subscription Solution**: Cloud-based software to automate suppliers and collect comprehensive data.
  2. **Transaction Solution**: Connecting 1.3 million suppliers globally with 18,000 sales centers.
  3. **B2C OTA**: Unique booking platform for travel and leisure.

### Leveraging AWS Cloud and Data Technologies

- Yanolja connected its three business models into a data lake using AWS technology, enabling the launch of a fourth business model: **Data Solution (Vertical AI Service)**.
- This allowed Yanolja to provide AI-based services like dynamic pricing, prediction models, and digital marketing tailored to suppliers, sales centers, and consumers.

### Customer-Centric Innovation Examples

1. **AI-based Personalized Platform**: Providing in-trip recommendations and personalized itineraries based on customer data.
2. **Automated Hotel Operations**: Integrating online and offline systems to streamline check-in, room service, and concierge services.
3. **Vertical AI Services**: Dynamic pricing, prediction models, and digital marketing tailored to the travel industry.

### Growth and Profitability Achievements

- Achieved over $7 billion in total transaction volume in Q3 2024.
- Over 120% year-over-year growth in revenue from global B2B solution businesses.
- Improved profitability with over 30% EBITDA margin through vertical AI services.
