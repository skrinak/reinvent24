# Summary: AWS re:Invent 2024 - Intel and AWS: Democratizing Generative AI Together (PRO209)

## Introduction

- The session focused on the partnership between Intel and AWS to democratize Generative AI (Gen AI) and make it more accessible, affordable, and adaptable for everyone.
- The speakers discussed the three phases of game-changing innovation: hype, backlash, and the new normal, emphasizing the importance of embracing Gen AI as the new normal.

## Generative AI Use Cases and Opportunities

- Gen AI has the potential to increase efficiency across various industries, leading to significant time and cost savings.
- Examples of Gen AI increasing efficiency include document summarization, code transformation, and version upgrades.
- The speakers highlighted Amazon's use of Gen AI, which saved the company 4,500 years of developer time.

## Intel and AWS Partnership

- Intel and AWS have partnered to build custom AI fabric chips and optimize Intel's Zion6 chips for AWS customers and partners.
- The partnership aims to address the high energy consumption and cost associated with running Gen AI workloads.
- Intel's 18A manufacturing process, featuring RibbonFET and power via technology, enables reduced power usage and increased performance.

## The Superportal

- AWS Professional Services created the Superportal, a SaaS application that allows users to securely preview Amazon EC2 instances powered by Intel processors for optimizing their workloads.
- The Superportal includes a benchmarking feature that compares Intel-powered EC2 instances across various industry use cases.
- Users can test instances for free before committing resources, ensuring cost efficiency and optimal performance.

## Open Source and OPEA

- The session highlighted the importance of open source in driving forward progress and innovation in Gen AI.
- Intel is collaborating with Amazon and other companies on the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA), managed by the Linux Foundation.
- OPEA aims to enable enterprises to deploy Gen AI solutions with a focus on security, scalability, cost efficiency, and agility.
- AWS Professional Services is building extensions and infrastructure-as-code models to integrate OPEA with AWS services like Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, and OpenSearch Service.

## Conclusion

- The speakers emphasized the importance of collaboration between companies like Intel and AWS to democratize Gen AI and enrich the lives of customers.
- They encouraged other companies to contribute to open source projects like OPEA to make Gen AI more affordable and accessible.
- The future envisioned is one where everyone has the opportunity to create, innovate, and communicate more efficiently using Gen AI responsibly.
