# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Accelerate App Migration: From Legacy to Production

## Introduction

- The average IT organization spends 80% of its resources on maintaining existing applications, leaving only 20% for innovation.
- This session explores how to shift that balance and accelerate the journey from legacy to production.

## Why Modernize?

### Benefits of Modernization

- Faster innovation and feature delivery
- Improved security and compliance
- Reduced operational costs
- Increased developer productivity
- Better customer experiences

### Characteristics of Modern Applications

- On-demand infrastructure provisioning
- Automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines
- Security built-in from the start
- Instrumentation and observability
- Consistent tooling across teams

### Five Pillars of Modern Applications

1. **Architecture Patterns**: Modular, event-driven microservices
2. **Operating Model**: Leverage AWS managed services
3. **Developer Enablement**: Self-service tools and infrastructure
4. **Management and Governance**: Embedded guardrails and best practices
5. **Data Management**: Purpose-built data strategies

## Challenges of Modernization

- Time and resource constraints
- Skills gap
- Budget constraints
- Technical debt
- Organizational resistance

## Getting Started with Modernization

### Three Key Phases

1. **Assess**: Discover the environment, identify pain points, and define the path forward.
2. **Modernize**: Refactor applications, build APIs, and leverage cloud-native architectures.
3. **Manage**: Ensure optimized operations using the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

## Tackling Legacy Code with Automation and AI

- Legacy code is a significant obstacle to modernization.
- Automation can handle the grunt work of code migrations, upgrades, and refactoring.
- Amazon CodeGuru Developer can accelerate code migration and modernization.

### Demo: Using Amazon CodeGuru Developer

- Migrating a Java 8 application to Java 17
- Generating unit tests and documentation
- Identifying and fixing security issues

## Strategies for Effective Modernization

### AWS Modernization Pathways

- Move to Cloud Native
- Move to Containers
- Move to Managed Databases
- Move to Open Source
- Move to Modern Analytics
- Move to Modern DevOps

### Refactoring Approaches

- Vertical Slice Refactoring
- Strangler Fig Pattern

### Best Practices

- Start small and reduce risk
- Use tools like Amazon CodeGuru Developer and modern CI/CD
- Introduce cultural change and celebrate successes
- Measure impact and track performance
- Engage with the AWS community and partners

## Conclusion

- Tools like Amazon CodeGuru Developer and methodologies like ModAx can help flip the 80/20 ratio and free up resources for innovation.
- Migration and modernization can be simple or complex, but start small and think big.
- Leverage the experience and resources available from AWS and the community.
