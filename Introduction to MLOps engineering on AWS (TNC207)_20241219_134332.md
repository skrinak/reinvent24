# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Introduction to MLOps Engineering on AWS

## Key Points

- Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is about creating and keeping a machine learning (ML) model productionalized for a long period.
- MLOps involves building, training, deploying, and monitoring ML models in a continuous and automated manner.
- The three pillars of MLOps are People, Processes, and Technology.

## Processes

- Identify the business problem and convert it into an ML problem.
- Collect and preprocess data (a crucial step, taking about 60% of the effort).
- Perform feature engineering to increase the model's predictive power.
- Train the model using algorithms like XGBoost, linear learners, or neural networks.
- Evaluate the model's performance against business objectives.
- Deploy the model to a production environment if it meets the criteria.
- Monitor and retrain the model periodically as its predictive capability degrades over time.

## People

- Key roles involved in MLOps:
  - ETL engineers (data cleaning)
  - Data scientists (algorithm selection and tuning)
  - MLOps engineers (building and maintaining the ML pipeline)
  - Governance officers (ensuring compliance and ethical use of data)
  - Model approvers (evaluating and approving models for production)
- Effective communication and collaboration between teams are crucial.

## Technology

- AWS SageMaker is a comprehensive service for MLOps, providing features for:
  - Data repositories (SageMaker Feature Store)
  - Code repositories
  - Model repositories (SageMaker Model Registry)
  - Data processing (SageMaker Data Wrangler, Processing Jobs)
  - Model training (SageMaker Training Jobs)
  - Model deployment (SageMaker Inference Endpoints)
  - Model monitoring (SageMaker Model Monitor)
- Other AWS services like EC2, Containers, and Kubernetes can also be used for MLOps workflows.

## Security and Governance

- Security should be built into the MLOps pipeline from the start (DevSecOps).
- SageMaker provides features for network security, data encryption, authentication, auditing, and compliance.
- ML governance is crucial for standardizing processes, capturing business metrics, managing permissions, monitoring model behavior, and ensuring transparency and explainability.
- SageMaker offers tools like Model Dashboard, Model Cards, and Role Manager for governance.

## MLOps Maturity Model

- The four phases of the MLOps maturity model are:
  1. Initial (experimentation)
  2. Repeatable (automation)
  3. Reliable (multi-account architecture)
  4. Scalable (standardized processes and expanded architecture)

## Demonstration

- The presenter demonstrated an MLOps pipeline built using AWS CodePipeline, triggered by changes to code repositories or new data in an S3 bucket.
- The pipeline automates steps like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, approval, deployment to development and production environments, and automated testing using AWS Step Functions.

## Key Takeaways

- Adopt MLOps practices with AWS SageMaker to build CI/CD pipelines, automate processes, and track lineages.
- Leverage AWS training resources, developer pavilions, and Skill Builder accounts to enhance MLOps skills.
