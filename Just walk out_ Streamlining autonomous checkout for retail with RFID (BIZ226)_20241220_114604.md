# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Just Walk Out: Streamlining Autonomous Checkout for Retail with RFID

## Summary

### Introduction

- The talk focuses on Amazon's Just Walk Out system and streamlining autonomous checkout with RFID technology.
- The speaker, Nathan O'Neill, is the Director of Technology with Amazon's Just Walk Out team in the AWS Solutions team.

### Value Drivers of Just Walk Out

- Top Line:
  - Increasing revenue by getting more people into the store and enabling them to shop efficiently.
  - Expanding hours of operation with fewer attendants required.
  - Enhancing the shopper experience with a differentiated, frictionless checkout experience.
  - Reducing theft and loss through better monitoring.

- Bottom Line:
  - Improving labor efficiency by requiring fewer associates.
  - Enabling quick inventory stock-taking with RFID technology.
  - Overall growth in store performance and profitability.

### Just Walk Out Technology Overview

- Standard Computer Vision-based Just Walk Out stores:
  - Entry and exit gates with customer authentication (credit card, mobile wallet, QR code).
  - Custom cameras and edge computing for tracking people and detecting products.
  - Sensor fusion for improved accuracy with small or thin products.
  - Robust network infrastructure with high uptime and availability.
  - Associate tools for inventory management and monitoring.

- Challenges in the Apparel Retail Market:
  - Long checkout lines deterring customers.
  - Inventory availability and differentiated shopper experiences.
  - Checkout line abandonment (75% of survey respondents left a line in the past year).
  - Staffing challenges and increasing labor costs.
  - Inventory visibility and accurate stock-taking.
  - Shrink (loss due to theft or misplacement).

### RFID Technology for Apparel Retail

- RFID operates in the radio frequency spectrum, typically between 400 MHz and 2.4 GHz.
- Passive and active RFID tags with bi-directional communication capabilities.
- RFID is well-suited for apparel retail due to its ability to count accurately and see through materials like cardboard, plastic, and woven fabrics.

### RFID Checkout Solution Development

- Initial focus on grocery stores for variable-weight products.
- Expansion to apparel retail and sports segments due to long checkout lines.
- First-generation RFID checkout solution:
  - All technology installed at the exit gates, enabling scalability from small to large stores.
  - Multiple antennas for tag reading and machine learning algorithms for accurate detection.
  - Successful deployments at Climate Pledge Arena, Lumen Field, and Texas Rangers Store.

- Second-generation RFID checkout solution (Just Walk Out RFID lanes):
  - Modular and mobile design for easy installation and reconfiguration.
  - Flexible integration with various payment methods, POS systems, and loyalty programs.
  - High accuracy in inventory counting and cycle counts (96% accuracy).
  - Versatility in pairing with existing systems and mixing with other solutions.
  - Demonstrated ease of installation and setup.

### Key Benefits and Customer Feedback

- 40-60% reduction in labor for store operation.
- 4 times faster checkout compared to traditional POS (around 15 seconds).
- 96% reduction in labor for cycle counting.
- Positive customer feedback on improved fan experience and elimination of checkout lines.
- Increased store throughput (2-3 times realized), expanded operating hours, and enhanced shopper experience.
- Reduced shrink (loss due to theft or misplacement).
- Increased bottom-line performance for customer stores.

### Conclusion

- RFID technology aligns with the Just Walk Out value proposition for frictionless retail and autonomous checkout.
- The future looks promising for RFID in stock checkout and enhancing the retail apparel experience.
