# Summary: Pitching Better Workshop for Overcoming Bias in Fundraising

## Introduction

- The workshop is designed to help underrepresented founders overcome bias in fundraising.
- It is based on the work of Professor Laura Huang, who studied gender parity in the startup world.
- Her research found that male-led startups raise five times more money than female-led startups in two years.

## Identifying Biased Questions

- Investors often ask biased questions that put founders on the defensive, rather than allowing them to promote their vision and ambition.
- Prevention questions focus on safety, security, and responsibility, while promotion questions focus on growth and potential.
- Examples of prevention questions: "How would you manage customer acquisition costs?", "How would you compete with market leaders?"

## The RIP Framework

1. **Reclaim**: Identify prevention questions and understand what they are really asking.
2. **Inform**: Answer the question directly, concisely, and with data/market benchmarks.
3. **Promote**: Use the opportunity to brag and sell the vision for your company.

## Answering Biased Questions

- Pause, clarify, and ask a promotional question to pivot the conversation.
- Anticipate prevention questions and practice promotional answers.
- Don't let prevention questions frustrate you; be self-aware of biases you may face.
- Always inform and promote, doubling down on the big potential of your business.

## Key Takeaways

- Fundraising is not a natural process; it requires rewiring your mindset to inform and promote effectively.
- Practice makes perfect; write down prevention questions and practice promotional answers.
- The workshop aims to empower founders to raise more money by overcoming biased questioning.
