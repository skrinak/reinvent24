# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Cloud Innovation for a Cause: One Organization's All-in AWS Journey

## Summary

The presentation covers the journey of Bonterra, an umbrella organization comprising several non-profit companies, as they migrated their entire IT infrastructure to AWS. The key points and insights are as follows:

### Background

- Bonterra had acquired several non-profit companies over the years, each with different hosting platforms (Heroku, on-premises, Azure, AWS, etc.).
- After evaluating options (staying on-premises, moving to GCP, Azure, or AWS), Bonterra chose AWS due to cost savings, strategic alignment with their mission, and the Migration Acceleration Program.

### Migration Process

- The migration involved consolidating 130 TB of data, 250 databases, and 8 products from various platforms to a standardized AWS architecture.
- A team of just 5 individuals, in partnership with AWS, completed the migration within 8 months.
- Key lessons learned:
  - Simplicity is often deceptive; migrations are complex, and lessons need to be re-learned.
  - Leadership buy-in is crucial, as some clients were initially reluctant to migrate.
  - Thorough documentation and understanding of existing systems are essential before migration.

### Benefits and Insights

- Consolidated billing and cost savings of around 50%.
- Implementing AWS Control Tower and Service Control Policies (SCPs) to control resource provisioning and costs.
- Standardized reference architecture simplified support and scalability.
- Upskilling and cross-pollination of ideas among existing teams.
- Automation through runbooks, Amazon ECS, and Amazon EKS to simplify operations.
- Conducting Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for incidents to prevent recurrences and improve automation.

### Future Plans

- Leveraging AI models and Amazon ECS to automate grant application processes for non-profit organizations, increasing success rates by 40%.
- Continued focus on automation, leveraging tools like Amazon ECS and Bedrock.

## Conclusion

Bonterra's all-in migration to AWS, although challenging, has yielded significant benefits in terms of cost savings, standardization, scalability, and automation. Their journey highlights the importance of thorough planning, documentation, leadership buy-in, and collaboration with AWS to achieve a successful cloud migration.
