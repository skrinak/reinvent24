# Summary

## NHL's Journey with AWS: From Encoding and Scheduling to Live Cloud Production and Analytics

### Encoding and Scheduling

- The NHL realized the need to get video content into the cloud to enable advanced capabilities.
- They built a system with AWS to automate the orchestration of video ecosystem components based on the game schedule.
- This involved ingesting game program feeds, isolated camera feeds, and syndication points into the cloud.
- It enabled distributing content to internal stakeholders, licensees, and linear/non-linear providers with minimal friction.

### Live Cloud Production

- The NHL showcased the first live remote game production entirely in the cloud, with the production team distributed across different locations.
- They produced the world feed in multiple languages and graphics packages for a pre-season game in Melbourne, Australia.
- On March 22nd, 2023, the NHL became the first North American league to produce and distribute a game entirely in the cloud.
- Producing in the cloud enabled flexibility, such as creating alternate broadcasts focused on analytics (NHL Edge Unlocked).
- It also had a positive environmental impact by reducing carbon dioxide emissions compared to traditional production methods.

### Analytics and Alternate Broadcasts

- The NHL leveraged AWS services to create various analytics from the puck and player tracking data.
- Analytics like Shot and Save Analytics, Face-off Probability, Opportunity Analysis, and Ice Tilt were developed to enhance fan engagement and storytelling.
- Alternate broadcasts like the "Big City Greens" animated feed and the American Sign Language broadcast for the Stanley Cup Final catered to diverse audiences.
- These alternate broadcasts allowed experimentation and brought in new demographics, such as tween girls, to hockey viewership.

### Future Outlook

- The NHL is excited to explore further components of live cloud production, such as supercharging highlight creation and leveraging AI for content identification.
- They aim to incorporate more insights from data and analytics into traditional broadcasts, enhancing the viewing experience.
- Experimenting with alternate broadcasts will continue, potentially leading to nightly or weekly occurrences and influencing the evolution of traditional broadcasts.

Overall, the NHL's partnership with AWS has been a methodical journey, enabling innovative solutions in live cloud production, data analytics, and content creation, while driving fan engagement and environmental sustainability.
