# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Streamline RAG and Model Evaluation with Amazon Bedrock (AIM359)

## Introduction

- Evaluating generative AI applications is crucial to ensure quality, latency, and cost-effectiveness.
- Evaluation helps align the application with the company's style, brand voice, and specific use cases.
- It also ensures reliability, trustworthiness, and adherence to responsible AI principles.

## Model Evaluation with Amazon Bedrock

### Challenges of Evaluation

- Finding the right models, metrics, algorithms, and datasets can be time-consuming.
- Setting up infrastructure, hosting models, and applications can be resource-intensive.
- Synthesizing and understanding evaluation results to iterate can be complex.

### Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation Features

- Curated datasets or bring your own datasets for relevant evaluation.
- Automatic evaluation: Algorithmic (F1 score, BERTScore) and LLM-as-a-judge (new).
- Human-based evaluation: Bring your own team or use AWS-managed service.
- Predefined and custom metrics.
- Easy to run with results in a few clicks.

### LLM-as-a-Judge

- Provides natural language explanations for evaluation scores.
- Offers quality metrics (correctness, completeness, readability, coherence) and responsible AI metrics (harmfulness, stereotyping, answer refusal).
- Uses judge prompt templates with high correlation to human annotators.
- Allows comparison across evaluation jobs.

## RAG Evaluation with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases

### What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

- LLM-powered search and answer generation.
- Augments input prompts with information retrieved from a knowledge source.
- Useful for proprietary data, recent data, and reducing hallucinations.

### Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases Data Ingestion

- Input data (e.g., PDFs) is parsed and chunked.
- Chunks are converted into vector embeddings and stored in a vector database.
- During runtime, the prompt is converted to a vector, and relevant chunks are retrieved and augmented into the prompt.
- The generator LLM then generates the final response based on the augmented prompt.

### Challenges of RAG Evaluation

- Ensuring data relevance in the knowledge base.
- Retrieving the right data during the retrieval process.
- Generating correct, complete, and limited hallucination answers.
- Evaluating quality and responsible AI aspects.
- Iteratively improving the entire lifecycle.

### RAG Evaluation Features

- Powered by LLM-as-a-judge technology.
- Evaluate retrieval only or end-to-end retrieve and generate.
- Integrate with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.
- Bring your own data for relevant evaluation.
- Easy-to-read reports with normalized scores and natural language explanations.
- Judge prompt templates available for transparency.
- Compare across jobs to iterate and improve.

- Reach out to account managers or solution architects for assistance.

## Conclusion

Amazon Bedrock's model evaluation and RAG evaluation features streamline the evaluation process, providing insights, transparency, and tools to build trustworthy and responsible generative AI applications.
