- Connecting data into a singular customer record is complex.
- Companies want to unify and connect data with greater governance to protect consumer privacy.
- Maintaining a strong customer data foundation while keeping up with technology advancements like generative AI is challenging.

### Solutions

- AWS Clean Rooms enables secure data collaboration without revealing underlying data or moving it from the cloud environment.
- AWS Entity Resolution helps unify first-party data within AWS Clean Rooms.
- A unified and enriched customer view is critical for deriving value from generative AI.
- AWS generative AI services like Amazon Bedrock can create hyper-personalized content across channels using customer data and machine learning.
