# Summary of AWS re:Invent 2024 - Practical application of generative AI chatbots in the public sector (WPS206)

## Introduction

The presentation discussed the potential of generative AI chatbots to improve customer experience and service delivery in the public sector. It highlighted the challenges faced by public sector agencies, such as budgetary constraints, legacy systems, regulatory compliance, and data governance issues. AWS introduced its Responsible AI framework to address concerns around fairness, explainability, privacy, security, and transparency when deploying AI and generative AI services.

## US Department of State Case Study

Howard Peng from the US Department of State shared their journey of transforming a massive service catalog (Foreign Affairs Manual and Handbooks) into an intelligent conversational interface using generative AI. Key points:

- The initial manual approach with interns was labor-intensive and not scalable.
- They transitioned to using AWS Bedrock and large language models within six weeks.
- The solution allowed them to control and reference authoritative sources while generating responses.
- Iterative development involved close collaboration with end-users and addressing responsible AI concerns.
- The modular approach enabled updating the language models as regulations changed.

## Architectural Patterns for Generative AI Chatbots

Naresh Dhiman from AWS discussed two architectural patterns for building generative AI chatbots using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process:

1. **Fully Managed RAG Experience with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases**
   - Utilizes Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for a fully managed RAG process.
   - Integrates with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to address responsible AI concerns.
   - Supports various data sources and dynamic data updates.

2. **Custom RAG Experience**
   - Suitable when specific technologies are not approved for use.
   - Requires building a custom ingestion pipeline and chunking strategy.
   - Leverages Amazon Bedrock's large language embedding models and text models.

## Service Catalog Demo

Naresh demonstrated a practical application of a generative AI chatbot for improving service delivery experience. Key highlights:

- Used a fabricated dataset related to employee benefits and expenses.
- Configured Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases with the dataset and a large language model.
- Implemented a Streamlit application as the service catalog chatbot.
- The chatbot provided conversational responses, URLs, and instructions based on user queries.
- Showed the potential for enhancing customer experience by providing instant and accurate information.

## Conclusion

The presentation showcased the practical applications of generative AI chatbots in the public sector, addressing challenges, architectural patterns, and a responsible AI framework. It highlighted the potential for improving customer experience and service delivery through intelligent conversational interfaces.
