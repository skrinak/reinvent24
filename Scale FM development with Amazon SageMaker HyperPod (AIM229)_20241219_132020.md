# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Scale FM Development with Amazon SageMaker HyperPod

## Introduction

- Shubha Kumbadakone, Senior Manager at AWS, introduced the panel discussion on developing foundation models using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod.
- The panelists included Jeff Boudier (Head of Product at Hugging Face), Waseem AlShikh (Co-founder and CTO at Writer), and Robert Bakos (Co-founder and CTO at HOPPR).

## Amazon SageMaker HyperPod Overview

- HyperPod is a differentiated gen AI infrastructure offering from AWS, designed for distributed training.
- It addresses key considerations for customers building foundation models:
  - Data readiness, labeling, and differentiation
  - Required GPU horsepower and accelerator choice
  - Cluster management, scaling efficiency, and resiliency

### Key Features and Benefits

- Persistent cluster on a single spine for reduced networking overhead
- Support for any distributed training framework (FSDP, DeepSpeed, etc.)
- Proprietary SageMaker distributed training libraries for performance enhancements
- Automated resiliency and node health monitoring
- Root access to nodes for profiling, visualization, and customization
- Flexibility to use existing tools, tech stacks, and job orchestration methods

## Panel Discussion Highlights

### Hugging Face (Jeff Boudier)

- Mission: Democratize good machine learning through open science, open source, and ethics-first principles.
- Built models like BLOOM, StarCoder, and IDEFICS to close the gap between open and closed models.
- Leverages HyperPod for internal science cluster, scaling up to 1,000 GPUs.
- Benefits include smart GPU management, CO2 consumption metrics, and cluster flexibility.
- Focuses on enabling customers to build and host their own models (e.g., HUGS on AWS Marketplace).

### Writer (Waseem AlShikh)

- Mission: Transform work for enterprises using generative AI.
- Built models like Palmyra X 004, focusing on deeper models rather than larger parameter counts.
- HyperPod enabled reliable, long-running training jobs and reduced operational overhead.
- Shifted thinking from GPU cost to resiliency and stability for better resource allocation.
- Plans to use Kubernetes HyperPod for inference with self-evolving models.

### HOPPR (Robert Bakos)

- Building foundation models in medical imaging and a medical-grade platform for inference.
- Leverages HyperPod for large-scale training on high-resolution 16-bit medical images.
- Benefits include flexibility, low-level customization, and optimized data distribution.
- Looking to use HyperPod for scalable inference on multiple images simultaneously.

## Distributed Training Techniques

- Panelists shared their experiences with distributed training libraries and techniques:
  - Hugging Face built Nanotron for large-scale training and Lighteval for evaluations.
  - Writer used PyTorch, NeMo Megatron, and their own "frugal transformer" implementation.
  - HOPPR primarily used DeepSpeed and PyTorch, with plans to implement FSDP.

## Inference Architectures

- Panelists discussed their plans for inference deployment:
  - Writer plans to use Kubernetes HyperPod for scalable inference with self-evolving models.
  - Hugging Face focuses on enabling customers to host their own models (e.g., HUGS on AWS Marketplace).
  - HOPPR aims to use HyperPod for scalable inference on multiple medical images simultaneously.

## Partnership with AWS

- The panelists highlighted the benefits of partnering with AWS:
  - Hugging Face collaborates on Deep Learning Containers, Trainium, and Inferentia for cost-effective AI deployment.
  - Writer appreciated the hands-on training and support from AWS during HyperPod adoption.
  - HOPPR credited AWS for enabling their work through services like Snowball, S3, Spark, FSX, and compute clusters.

In summary, the panel discussion highlighted the capabilities of Amazon SageMaker HyperPod in scaling foundation model development, the panelists' innovative approaches, and the value of the AWS partnership in enabling their missions.
