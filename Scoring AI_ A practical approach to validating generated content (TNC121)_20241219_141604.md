# Summary: Scoring AI: A Practical Approach to Validating Generated Content

## Introduction
- Mark Eliason (AWS Enterprise Skills Transformation) and Barbara Ristau (AWS Training and Certification) discuss the importance of validating and scoring content generated by AI models.
- Generative AI is a powerful tool, but it has limitations and may not always provide accurate or consistent results.
- Subject matter expertise and human intelligence are still essential in the process of validating AI-generated content.

## Challenges and Benefits of Generative AI
- Keeping up with the rapid pace of innovation and the vast amount of information available is difficult.
- Generative AI can unlock new possibilities and provide productivity gains, but it is not a perfect solution for everything.
- Generative AI outputs can be non-deterministic, meaning the same prompt can produce slightly different results.
- AWS customers are realizing the benefits of generative AI in various industries, such as travel, finance, and healthcare.

## The Importance of Scoring Content
- Scoring content is crucial to ensure accuracy, compliance, completeness, and consistency.
- Measuring and managing content quality is essential, especially in mission-critical or regulated industries.
- Scoring introduces discipline and a repeatable process, which helps mitigate the non-deterministic nature of generative AI.
- Defining what constitutes "good" quality and aligning expectations among team members is vital.

## AWS Training and Certification's Approach
- AWS Training and Certification has been experimenting with generative AI for over a year and has developed a scoring methodology.
- They defined four criteria for evaluating content: correctness, compliance, completeness, and consistency (the "4 Cs").
- A scoring scale from 1 to 5 was established based on the number of adjustments required to make the content publishable.
- Tools were developed to automate and scale the scoring process, including a front-end application (the "Workbench") and a backend scoring service powered by large language models.
- Feedback loops were created to capture user feedback on the scores and improve the scoring solution continuously.

## Example and Key Takeaways
- An example was provided on addressing compliance with the AWS style guide, specifically the usage of the word "allow."
- Generative AI was used to reduce style guide defects by 40%, demonstrating significant productivity gains.
- Perfection is not required to realize benefits from generative AI; even scores of 4 (needing a few tweaks) can lead to substantial time savings.
- Scoring promotes meaningful discussions around content quality and effective use of subject matter experts' time.
- Advice for embarking on a generative AI journey includes embracing experimentation, using scoring to drive discussions, and celebrating small wins along the way.
