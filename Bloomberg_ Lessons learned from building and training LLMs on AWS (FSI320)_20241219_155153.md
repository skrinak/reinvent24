# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Bloomberg: Lessons Learned from Building and Training LLMs on AWS

## Introduction

- Bloomberg decided to train its own large language model, BloombergGPT, as a research project to explore how to build applications around LLMs.
- The challenges included high infrastructure costs, availability of GPUs, access to a large corpus of high-quality data, and a talented team.
- Bloomberg partnered with AWS to leverage their GPU resources and managed services like Amazon SageMaker.

## Building the Training Infrastructure

### Data Management
- The training dataset was 3.5 TB, and checkpoints were 600 GB each, requiring high throughput and low latency storage.
- Amazon FSx for Lustre was used to manage training data, and S3 for backup and syncing.
- Proper resource policies, encryption, and access controls were implemented for data security.

### Compute Allocation and Monitoring
- NVIDIA A100 GPUs on P4d instances were used, with 8 GPUs per node.
- Monitoring and cost attribution for GPU usage were essential.

### Operational Challenges
- Recoverable and non-recoverable errors were defined, and remediation controls were implemented using CloudWatch, SNS, and Lambda.
- Underutilization of GPUs and training convergence issues were addressed through instrumentation and monitoring.

## Key Learnings

### BloombergGPT Model
- The model performed better on finance-specific tasks than general-purpose models with more parameters.
- It provided valuable insights but was never intended for production applications.

### Guiding Principles for LLM Product Integration
1. Model outputs must be derived from trustworthy sources and reflect reality.
2. Evaluate the model in the context of user interaction and provide guidance.
3. Provide transparent attribution to the original data sources used by the model.

### Product Applications
- Generating BQL (Bloomberg Query Language) queries from natural language prompts.
- Summarizing earnings call transcripts with context attribution.

### Future Considerations
- AWS SageMaker HyperPod provides turnkey training infrastructure and tools.
- NVIDIA H100 GPUs offer increased throughput for training.
- Fine-tuning existing open-source models may be more efficient than training custom models from scratch.
- The Envoy AI Gateway project aims to simplify the integration of multiple LLMs into enterprise AI stacks.

## Conclusion
- Bloomberg's experience with BloombergGPT informed their approach to using Generative AI in products while maintaining trust and transparency.
- Continuous evaluation, monitoring, and iteration are essential for effective LLM integration.
