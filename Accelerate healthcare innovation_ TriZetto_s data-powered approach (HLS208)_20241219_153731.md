# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Accelerate healthcare innovation: TriZetto's data-powered approach

## Summary

### Introduction

- Matt Pearson, Head of Healthcare Life Sciences Business Development at AWS, emphasizes the importance of deep collaboration between technology companies, healthcare providers, and payers to drive innovation and improve patient outcomes.
- The session focuses on the partnership between AWS and TriZetto, a Cognizant company, to address challenges in claims management and the enrollment process in the healthcare industry.

### Challenges in Healthcare

#### Claims Management
- Increasing complexity of claims and data (structured and unstructured)
- Rising administrative costs due to legacy systems
- Complex regulatory and compliance requirements
- Data accuracy, reconciliation, and integration issues

#### Enrollment Process
- Complex systems and steps involved
- Data accuracy and integration challenges

#### Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)
- Migration from on-premises to cloud
- High operational and infrastructure costs
- Limited scalability
- Disaster recovery and business continuity challenges
- Data silos and integration challenges

### Goals and Objectives

- Automatic claims processing with zero-touch claims
- Seamless data exchange between providers
- Improved data accuracy and integration (interoperability)
- Regulatory and compliance adherence
- Optimized enrollment process and member experience

### TriZetto's Approach with AWS

- Leveraging AWS's cloud technology and TriZetto's industry expertise
- Migrating core administrative systems (Facets and QNXT) to AWS Cloud
- Implementing containerized deployments (EKS) and managed services (RDS, FSX)
- Automating deployments and standardizing environments
- Collaborating on reference architectures and solution designs

### Customer Transformations

#### Large Midwestern Blue Cross Blue Shield Plan
- Successful migration of Facets G6 to AWS within a year
- Achieved high performance (2.4 million claims per hour)
- Leveraged automation and standardization for rapid implementation

#### Geisinger Health Plan
- Migrated Facets and other TriZetto solutions to AWS
- Improved scalability and performance
