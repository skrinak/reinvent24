# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Building Core Capabilities: The Secret to Innovation at Scale

## Summary

The talk focuses on strategies and core capabilities that enable companies to drive innovation at scale as they grow. The speaker, Anne Hunt, presents four rules or tenets for fostering innovation at scale:

### 1. Shared Customer Obsession

- Foster a deep understanding of customers across all teams.
- Implement a Customer Data Platform (CDP) to provide shared customer knowledge and insights.
- Enable personalized experiences throughout the customer journey.

### 2. Insist on the Highest Standards

- Continuously manage and refactor technical debt to avoid bottlenecks.
- Prioritize customer outcomes when addressing technical debt.
- Leverage tools like feature flagging, version control, and AI-powered code analysis.
- Align business and technical priorities for technical debt management.

### 3. Small Autonomous Teams

- Organize teams around loosely coupled software systems (Conway's Law).
- Empower teams to own the entire lifecycle of their systems.
- Promote team and architecture cohesion through API-driven design.
- Treat data and AI capabilities as products for internal teams.

### 4. Mechanisms to Promote Ideas from Anywhere

- Implement a "Working Backwards" process for capturing and evaluating ideas.
- Provide mechanisms for customer discovery (qualitative and quantitative).
- Enable self-service experimentation at scale for teams.

## Key Insights

- Shared customer knowledge across teams enables coherent and personalized customer experiences.
- Continuous refactoring and alignment between business and technical priorities are crucial for managing technical debt.
- Small, autonomous teams aligned with loosely coupled systems optimize for innovation.
- Treating data and AI capabilities as internal products empowers teams to innovate.
- Established mechanisms for idea generation, customer discovery, and experimentation promote innovation from anywhere in the organization.

## Important Conclusions

To drive innovation at scale, companies should:

1. Implement core platform capabilities like CDPs, data governance, and AI services for internal teams.
2. Continuously manage technical debt and align business and technical priorities.
3. Organize teams around loosely coupled systems and promote team autonomy.
4. Establish mechanisms for capturing ideas, customer discovery, and self-service experimentation.

By following these principles and building the right platform capabilities, companies can foster a culture of innovation that scales as they grow.
