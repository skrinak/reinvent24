# Grindr's AI-First Approach with AWS: Enabling Inclusive User Connections

## Introduction

- LGBTQ inclusion is not just a good thing to do, but it's also good business, as the LGBTQ community is the fastest-growing minority segment in the U.S., with over $1.4 trillion in spending power.
- Grindr is the largest LGBT social media platform in the world, with a market cap of $2.14 billion as of 2024 and 13.5 million monthly users in nearly every country.

## Grindr's Mission and Vision

- Grindr's mission is to build the "global Gayborhood" in users' pockets and make a world where the lives of the global LGBTQ community are free, equal, and just.
- The app aims to replicate the sense of community found in physical Gayborhoods, enabling instant connections both locally and globally.

## Grindr's Unique Strengths

- Built by and for the LGBTQ community, Grindr has become the connective tissue for many gay, bi, trans, and queer people worldwide.
- Strong user base: large, diverse, highly educated, affluent, and highly engaged (users spend roughly an hour per day on the app).
- Ability to translate virtual connections into real-life meetings (over 500 million location shares in 2023).

## Grindr's Culture and AI Strategy

- Building a performance-driven culture of excellence and execution, with lean and driven teams.
- Harnessing AI both in what they build and how they build it, including automating workflows and leveraging AI for features like recommendations and personalization.

## Productizing the Gayborhood

### Core Product Roadmap

- Evolving the core product by building new features to capture user intent better, improving pricing and packaging, and better internationalizing the product.
- Introducing dedicated spaces for different intentions, such as a "Right Now" space for casual dating and a dedicated product for finding relationships, leveraging AI for features like profile curation, matchmaking, and conversation assistance.
- Launching add-on features like Roam (for pre-travel connections), boosting, interests, insights, and recommendations.

### Gayborhood Expansion Opportunities

- Travel and local discovery: Leveraging the map and Roam features to build better travel experiences, event listings, and local business discovery.
- Health and wellness: Offering advice, interactive AI-enabled experiences, and potentially consumer cosmetic medications tailored to the LGBTQ community's needs.

## Conclusion

- Grindr aims to build the global Gayborhood by evolving its core product, expanding into new use cases, and harnessing AI and ML across the application.
- The company's strong relationship with the LGBTQ community presents an unparalleled opportunity to have a significant impact on their lives while building a robust and enduring business.
