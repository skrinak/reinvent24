## Customer Use Case: Life360

Life360, a family safety app, adopted Amazon Q Business to boost employee productivity and address the following challenges:

1. **Knowledge-based Search**: Developed an internal bot assistant (Cloud Companion) to provide a single entry point for accessing information across various data sources.
