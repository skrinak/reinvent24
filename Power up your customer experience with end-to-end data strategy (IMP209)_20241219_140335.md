# Summary: Power up your Customer Experience with End-to-End Data Strategy

## Introduction

- Customers want to provide exceptional experiences to their customers, but often struggle with scattered data sources and lack a unified strategy.
- This session covers the importance of creating an end-to-end data strategy and how to build one.

## Why Create an End-to-End Data Strategy?

### Benefits
- Enables centralized data integration from various sources
- Facilitates advanced analytics, machine learning, AI, and generative AI applications
- Provides quick insights from large volumes of data for better decision-making
- Improves customer experience and loyalty
- Helps organizations stay ahead of the competition
- Reduces data operation costs

### Challenges
- Handling rapidly growing data volumes
- Integrating diverse data formats (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)
- Lack of technical skills for machine learning and generative AI
- Ensuring data governance, compliance, and security

## What is a Modern Data Strategy?

- A plan of aligned actions with an agile approach to evolve and expand over time
- Focuses on three key factors: technology, people & processes, and mindset
- Accelerates creating value using data, supporting business goals

## Building a Modern Data Architecture

### Data Discovery
- Define business value and goals
- Identify user personas and data usage patterns
- Identify data sources (databases, files, applications)
- Determine appropriate data storage (relational database, data lake)
- Plan data processing and application development

### Data Architecture Layers
- Data Sources (streaming, batch, structured, unstructured)
- Ingestion (e.g., AWS Data Migration Service)
- Storage (Amazon S3, landing zone, raw data, curated data)
- Data Cataloging
- Processing (cleaning, enrichment)
- Consumption (data exploration, analytics, warehousing)
- Segmentation and Personalization (e.g., Amazon Personalize)
- Security and Governance
