# Boost Fundraising with Hyper-Personalization Powered by Amazon Bedrock

## Summary

This session discussed how the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Anderson School of Management used AWS and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet LLM, in partnership with Slalom, to revolutionize their alumni engagement strategy and boost fundraising efforts. The key points and insights are:

### Background and Motivation

- UCLA Anderson aimed to increase alumni engagement and donations to support the institution's mission and long-term stability.
- Traditional fundraising emails had low open rates and conversion rates, lacking personalization and compelling content.
- The project aimed to leverage Generative AI (GenAI) and hyper-personalization to create more engaging and effective fundraising emails.

### Technical Implementation

- The solution was built on AWS using services like S3, Lambda, and Bedrock, integrating with Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
- Data on alumni (name, email, giving history, program, graduation year) was extracted and used to train the LLM (Claude 3) for personalized content generation.
- Prompt engineering and conditional prompting were employed to constrain the LLM's behavior and ensure personalized, human-like responses.
- Automated and human validation processes were implemented to ensure the quality, safety, and trustworthiness of the generated content.

### Results and Impact

- The project resulted in an 86% increase in donation conversion rates and a 26% increase in average donation size, leading to a staggering 132% increase in total dollars raised.
- Open rates for AI-generated emails were significantly higher than traditional emails, demonstrating improved engagement.
- The successful pilot paved the way for further exploration of AI in fundraising and other areas of the university.

### Key Insights and Conclusions

- Generative AI can effectively personalize and enhance fundraising communications, leading to improved engagement and donation outcomes.
- Integrating AI into existing processes and systems (e.g., Salesforce) is crucial for seamless adoption and scalability.
- Prompt engineering, validation, and governance are essential for ensuring the quality, safety, and trustworthiness of AI-generated content.
- The project demonstrated the potential of AI to drive innovation and organizational success in higher education institutions.
- Data quality and governance are critical for effective AI implementations, emphasizing the need for better data hygiene and management practices.

The session highlighted the transformative potential of Generative AI in higher education, particularly in areas like fundraising and alumni engagement, while underscoring the importance of responsible AI implementation and governance.
