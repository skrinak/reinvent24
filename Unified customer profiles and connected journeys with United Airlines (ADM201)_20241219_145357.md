The speakers discussed the challenges, benefits, and key use cases of implementing a Customer 360 strategy.

## Key Points

### Customer 360 and Its Importance

- Data diversity, consent requirements, and data privacy laws add complexity.
- Stakeholders may have varying levels of access to data sources.
