# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Transforming BMW Sustainability Operations with AWS and Catena-X

## Summary

### Introduction to AWS Supply Chain

- AWS Supply Chain is a cloud-based supply chain management application that helps make supply chains more resilient and react to unexpected disruptions in supply and demand.
- It provides features like:
  - Creating a supply chain data lake with data from various sources
  - Identifying and mitigating inventory risks
  - Automated demand forecasting
  - Supply planning with factors like costs and service levels
  - Secure and efficient collection of sustainability data across the supply chain

### BMW's Challenges and Innovations

- BMW faces challenges in managing a global, multi-tier supply chain with visibility, sustainability, quality, and traceability requirements.
- They initially tried building their own platform but failed to roll it out across suppliers due to the "one solution fits all" approach.
- BMW co-founded Catena-X, an industry coalition, to build shared industry protocols and data services for end-to-end business process optimization.
- Catena-X aims to provide interoperability, freedom of choice, data sovereignty, and trust through open standards and regional hubs.
- Benefits include optimizing business processes end-to-end, choosing solution providers, and ensuring data sensitivity and trust.

### AWS and Catena-X Integration

- AWS announced the integration of AWS Supply Chain with Catena-X for standardized data exchange in the automotive industry.
- The solution simplifies the process of uploading and sharing data (certificates, product carbon footprint, traceability) with Catena-X automakers.
- It provides a secure, standardized, and efficient exchange without cumbersome IT setup for suppliers.
- The demo showcased the easy upload, sharing, and management of certificates with the Catena-X network.
- The timeline includes launching certificate and ECU data exchange in early 2025, followed by carbon footprint and traceability data.

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- Global supply chains face challenges like visibility, sustainability, quality, and traceability, requiring end-to-end optimization.
- Industry collaboration and open standards are crucial for interoperability, data sovereignty, and trust in multi-tier supply chains.
- AWS Supply Chain and its integration with Catena-X aim to simplify and standardize the exchange of sustainability and traceability data in the automotive industry.
- The solution promises to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enable better collaboration between automakers and suppliers.
- AWS and Catena-X are committed to driving digital transformation and solving multiple use cases in the automotive industry.
