# AWS re:Invent 2024 - How to Achieve Water Goals with AWS Technology (SUS204)

## Introduction

- Beau Schilz from the AWS Water Infrastructure Team discussed AWS's goals around water sustainability, their progress, and how they're using AWS services to meet those goals.
- Ashwin Chandran from McCord Development Group shared how they're using AWS services to manage water at a utility scale for a development outside Houston, Texas.

## AWS's Water Sustainability Goals and Progress

### The Goal

By 2030, AWS aims to return more water to communities and the environment than they use in their direct operations.

### Progress

- AWS is 41% of the way towards being water positive.
- Water efficiency: AWS has reduced water usage from 0.25 liters per kilowatt-hour to 0.18 liters per kilowatt-hour.
- Sustainable sources: 24 AWS facilities globally are using recycled water.
- Water replenishment: AWS has contracted or delivered nearly 2 billion gallons of returned water through replenishment projects.

## AWS's Four Pillars for Water Sustainability

### 1. Efficiency

- AWS has an elegant design that optimizes power and water efficiency, using outside air for cooling most of the year.
- They built the Poseidon program to centralize data from thousands of sensors, enabling operators to reduce water usage.
- AWS also developed custom IoT gateways to collect data from remote flow meters, saving time and effort.
- Automated ticketing system alerts operators when water usage exceeds expectations, improving accountability.

### 2. Sustainable Sources

- AWS plans to work with utilities to develop new sustainable sources like recycled water for over 100 data centers globally.
- They aim to capture rainwater for cooling operations at 10 locations by 2030.
- AWS expects to have around 50 data centers by 2030 where discharged water can be repurposed for community irrigation.

### 3. Water Replenishment

- AWS partners with organizations to restore watersheds and return water to communities.
- Projects include repairing native ecosystems in California's river corridors and converting flood irrigation to drip irrigation in Latin America.

### 4. Investing in Water Technology

- AWS launched the Climate Pledge Fund in 2022 to invest in companies that can help meet sustainability goals.
- They invested in Subeca, an IoT company focused on water management solutions.
- AWS has an exceptional IoT and analytics team working on water-related projects.

## McCord Development Group's Water Management Solution

### The Problem

- Water accountability and non-revenue water losses are significant issues for utilities and cities.
- McCord Development needed a solution to understand and optimize water usage in their new development.

### The Solution: MizuWatch

- MizuWatch is a digital twin for water distribution systems built on the open-source Garnet framework and AWS IoT services.
- It ingests data from flow meters, provides utilization analytics, anomaly detection, and capacity planning.
- The modular design allows integration with billing, service dispatch, and other systems.

### Benefits and Results

- Anomaly detection alerts helped identify and address water losses, saving millions of gallons.
- The system provides insights for capacity planning and forecasting water demand.
- It enables vendor and technology agnosticism, avoiding lock-in.
- The solution can integrate various IoT data sources, enabling a holistic smart city approach.

### Collaboration and Future Plans

- McCord Development collaborated closely with the AWS Garnet development team to build and refine the solution.
- They plan to integrate the solution with other districts and expand to other smart city verticals like parking and traffic management.

## Key Takeaways

- AWS is committed to water sustainability through efficiency, sustainable sources, replenishment, and investing in water technology.
- IoT, analytics, and cloud services play a crucial role in optimizing water usage, detecting anomalies, and enabling data-driven decision-making.
- Collaboration between technology providers and end-users is essential for developing effective water management solutions.
- Addressing water challenges requires a holistic approach that considers environmental impact, regulations, and long-term sustainability.
