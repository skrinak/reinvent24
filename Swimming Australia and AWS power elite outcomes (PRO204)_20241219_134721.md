# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Swimming Australia and AWS Power Elite Outcomes

## Introduction

- Jess Corones, General Manager of the Olympic Program at Swimming Australia, and Annie Naveh, Senior Data Scientist at AWS, presented their work on leveraging technology to enhance athlete performance.
- Swimming is an integral part of Australian culture, and many world-class swimmers come from Australia.
- At the recent Paris Olympics, the Australian swim team led by Jess had an extremely successful campaign, winning 18 medals, including 7 golds.

## The Role of Technology in High-Performance Swimming

- Technology can be a game-changer when combined with human experience, elevating performance to achieve the best results.
- Swimming Australia has been developing insight applications to provide coaches and sports scientists with access to data when and where they need it most.
- Good quality data is critical to understanding performance, and Swimming Australia has developed a race analysis software system called Sparta2 to analyze races and competitors.
- The biggest gains come from the training pool, which is the "F1 garage" where athletes hone their performance and improve.
- Immediate feedback during training is essential for athlete development and reinforcing learning.
- Combining coaching experience and intuition with meaningful data is the impactful combination for driving human performance.

## The Training Insights Solution

- Training Insights is a new performance analysis system that uses optical analysis in the training pool.
- It has a hybrid edge and cloud architecture to process high-resolution video frames in bandwidth-constrained environments.
- The system uses AWS Panorama as an edge device to deploy machine learning models and process camera frames.
- The machine learning pipeline detects and tracks swimmers, calculates athlete training metrics (e.g., distances, times, velocities, stroke mechanics), and sends the data to a cloud-based application.
- Coaches and performance support staff can view the training metrics in real-time and make data-driven coaching decisions.
- The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for the incorporation of additional machine learning models to detect various aspects of swimming performance (e.g., wall touch, breathing, kicks, reaction time).

## The Importance of Data-Driven Coaching

- Having access to multiple data metrics allows coaches to build a more powerful and complete swimming strategy.
- Data points such as breakouts, breaths, and kicks can be layered to provide a comprehensive picture of an athlete's performance.
- The integration of diverse data points enables coaches to refine every element of a swimmer's preparation, leading to smarter, more personalized training and better race outcomes.
- The combination of data and training insights empowers athletes to perform at their best, turning every fraction of a second into an opportunity for success.

## Conclusion

- Training Insights unlocks exciting opportunities for performance support teams, coaches, and athletes.
- With the medal gap closing between Australia and the US, Swimming Australia is setting its sights on big things for the LA Olympics in 2028 and the Brisbane Olympics in 2032.
- High-performance swimming is a global race, and continuous innovation and improvement are necessary to win gold medals.
