# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Solving different data ingestion use cases with AWS (ANT330).txt

# Summary

## Data Ingestion Landscape and Modern Data Architecture

- The presentation discusses the changing landscape of data ingestion and modern data architecture strategies.
- It highlights the importance of seamless data ingestion as a key pillar in modern data architectures.
- Three main patterns of data ingestion are identified:
  1. Inside-out: Data ingested from a centralized data lake to purpose-built data stores (data warehouses, ML applications, log analytics).
  2. Outside-in: Data generated by business partners and shared with the centralized data hub.
  3. Around the perimeter: Data sharing between different business units for common goals.

## Data Ingestion into Data Warehouses (Amazon Redshift)

- Zero-ETL (Zero Extract, Transform, Load) is introduced as a point-to-point data movement approach without creating ETL pipelines.
- Zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Aurora MySQL, PostgreSQL, RDS MySQL, and DynamoDB for ingesting data into Redshift are discussed.
- Other ingestion patterns covered:
  - Streaming ingestion from Kinesis Data Streams or Apache Kafka (MSK) for near-real-time data warehousing.
  - Auto-copy for ingesting data from files landing on S3.
  - Batch ingestion from on-premises databases using AWS DMS or third-party ETL tools like Informatica or dbt.

## Data Ingestion into Data Lakes

- AWS Glue is presented as a serverless data ingestion, discovery, and preparation service with data quality rules and data catalog capabilities.
- Glue supports over 70 built-in connectors and the ability to bring your own connectors for various data sources.
- Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka) are discussed for real-time data ingestion into data lakes.
- Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is introduced for ingesting data into data lakes in specific formats (e.g., Parquet, CSV) with dynamic partitioning.

## Lakehouse Approach and Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse

- The Lakehouse approach bridges the gap between data warehouses and data lakes, providing a centralized data store for querying.
- Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse is introduced as a service that integrates data across data warehouses, data lakes, operational data sources, and applications.
- Zero-ETL integrations with SageMaker Lakehouse are discussed, including integrations with first-party sources (DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Aurora) and third-party applications (Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow).
- SageMaker Lakehouse supports Apache Iceberg Open APIs, allowing ingestion from custom applications, AWS Glue, and third-party tools.

## Open Table Formats and Modern Data Lakes

- Open table formats like Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, and Delta Lake are discussed for modern data lakes.
- AWS Glue and Amazon EMR are capable of ingesting and processing data in these open table formats.

## Data Ingestion into Log and Search Analytics (Amazon OpenSearch Service)

- Amazon OpenSearch Service is introduced as a scalable, secure service for log and security analytics, as well as search use cases (text-based, semantic, and vector searches).
- Zero-ETL integrations with DynamoDB, DocumentDB, and S3 are discussed for ingesting data into OpenSearch.
- Direct query integrations with S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Security Lake are presented, allowing querying data from OpenSearch without ingesting it.
- OpenSearch ingestion is recommended for collecting, transforming, buffering, and routing data to OpenSearch indices, with custom transformations and scalability.

## Reference Architecture and Key Strategies

- A comprehensive reference architecture is presented, covering data ingestion from various sources (Aurora, DynamoDB, Kinesis Data Streams, SaaS applications, S3 files, logs) into target systems (Redshift, S3 Data Lake, Lakehouse, OpenSearch).
- Key strategies are discussed for each ingestion service, including performance optimization, cost-effectiveness, fault tolerance, error handling, and operational best practices.
