# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Unleashing compassion_ AWS for child protection & data governance (IMP210).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Compassion International's Mission**: Compassion International is a nonprofit organization dedicated to breaking the generational cycle of poverty by serving children in need across 29 countries. Their mission is to provide holistic child development, including medical interventions, food, hygiene kits, and disaster relief efforts.

2. **Becoming a Data-Driven Organization**: Compassion International is evolving to become a data-driven organization to better protect children and fulfill its mission objectives. This involves:
   - Adopting a platform thinking mindset
   - Implementing a data fabric design pattern for trusted data sharing
   - Encouraging project-based learning and innovation through events like AI Hackathons and Ignite weeks

3. **Data Fabric Design Pattern**: Compassion implemented a data fabric pattern to enable consistent data access and governance across the organization. Key aspects include:
   - Data model and Compassion Outcomes Framework for understanding data relationships
   - Data catalog for data discovery and stewardship
   - Storage layer for serving data at required latencies

4. **Protecting Children with Data**: Compassion developed the PATCh (Protection of Children) project to screen addresses and content (images, videos, text) for potential threats to children. This involves:
   - Standardizing and hashing addresses for efficient screening
   - Using AWS services like EventBridge, Lambda, DynamoDB, and Comprehend for content analysis
   - Implementing a multi-tenant system with configurable screening rules per application/neighbor

5. **Data Lakes and Intelligent Document Processing**: The presentation highlighted two broadly applicable concepts:
   - Data Lakes: Using AWS Lake Formation for simplified data access, delegated governance, data access catalog, and centralized auditing across the data lake stack.
   - Intelligent Document Processing: Leveraging AWS AI services like Amazon Comprehend for tasks like entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and document classification without needing deep machine learning expertise.
