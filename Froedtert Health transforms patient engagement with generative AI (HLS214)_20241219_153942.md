# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Froedtert Health transforms patient engagement with generative AI

## Summary

### Introduction

- The session focuses on how Froedtert Health leveraged AWS cloud and generative AI to transform patient engagement and deliver innovative healthcare experiences.
- Dr. Melek from Froedtert Health and Naqi Khan from AWS share their insights and journey.

### Froedtert Health's Cloud Journey

- Froedtert Health started their cloud journey with a focus on transformation and rethinking how to reach patients where they are.
- They realized that technology is the business in healthcare and shifted their strategy to build a digital platform for patient care experiences.
- Key lessons learned:
  - Treat data as a longitudinal patient journey, not just medical records.
  - Build a product-driven, engineering-focused culture with small, cross-functional teams.
  - Adopt a serverless, cloud-native approach using AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, and Step Functions.
  - Integrate with existing healthcare systems (EHR) while embracing cloud capabilities.

### Leveraging AWS for Transformation

- Froedtert Health utilized the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator for Healthcare to establish a robust foundation.
- They built a health data platform using AWS services like Kinesis, Spark, and S3 for data ingestion, processing, and storage.
- AWS Lambda played a crucial role in enabling agile development, experimentation, and cost savings.
- The cloud journey enabled dual transformation: transforming the core business and exploring future business models.

### Generative AI and Open Source Contributions

- Froedtert Health quickly adopted AWS Bedrock and used it as a copilot for clinicians, integrating it with their EHR system.
- They leveraged GRAG (Generative Retrieval Augmented Generation) to ground Bedrock on their clinical guidelines and best practices.
- Froedtert Health is open-sourcing their CDK (Cloud Development Kit) constructs, Lambda functions, and HIPAA-compliant data sources on AWS to contribute to the healthcare community.

### Outcomes and Future Plans

- Froedtert Health has seen a 10% year-over-year growth in their patient population and a 20% increase in monthly active users of their digital services.
- 75% of their patients interacted with them digitally at least once in the last year.
- They are launching "Here Health," a digital-first primary care clinic, leveraging generative AI to provide personalized patient experiences.
- The cloud strategy enabled them to transform the core business while exploring innovative healthcare delivery models.

### Key Takeaways

- Embrace cloud technology as a strategic enabler for healthcare transformation.
- Adopt a product-driven, engineering-focused culture with cross-functional teams.
- Leverage serverless architectures and AWS services for agile development and experimentation.
- Integrate generative AI and open-source contributions to drive innovation and collaboration in healthcare.
- Focus on delivering personalized, digital-first patient experiences leveraging data and technology.
