# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Security Best Practices that Accelerate Mission Impact

## Summary

### AWS's Approach to Security
- AWS follows a shared responsibility model for security, where AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, and customers are responsible for security in the cloud.
- AWS offers cost-effective security services that can scale with your workloads, automate security processes, provide compliance framework evaluation tools, and leverage AI/ML for improved security posture.

### Common Non-Profit Security Challenges
- Critical data privacy and protection needs
- Lean, mission-focused technical teams with limited time for security processes
- Budgets and resources prioritized for projects driving direct mission impact
- Unique workloads with no one-size-fits-all security solutions

### Best Practices to Accelerate Mission Impact

#### Automation Enables Scale
- **AWS Config** for continuous compliance monitoring and configuration management
- **Amazon GuardDuty** for intelligent threat detection and automated remediation
- **AWS Security Hub** to aggregate findings from various security tools into a single pane of glass

#### Centralized Logging for Faster Analysis
- **Amazon GuardDuty** and **AWS Security Hub** for aggregating findings across AWS regions and accounts
- **Amazon Security Lake** for aggregating log data from all AWS environments into a single data lake using the Open Cybersecurity Schema Format (OCSF)
- Benefits: improved visibility, faster incident response, simplified compliance and auditing, enhanced root cause analysis

#### AI-Driven Processes
- **CodeGuru Security** and **Amazon CodeWhisperer** for static application security testing, detecting vulnerable secrets, and infrastructure as code security scans
- AI helps identify vulnerabilities earlier in the development lifecycle (shift-left approach)

### Key Takeaways
- Strong security processes can accelerate mission impact by leveraging automation, centralized logging, and AI/ML-driven processes.
- Automation enables scale, especially for lean, mission-focused teams.
- Centralized logging helps understand the overall security posture and get to the root of incidents faster.
- Leveraging AI and development tools helps identify vulnerabilities sooner in the development lifecycle.
