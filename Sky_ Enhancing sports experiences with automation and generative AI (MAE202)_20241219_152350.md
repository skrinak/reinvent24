# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Sky: Enhancing sports experiences with automation and generative AI

## Summary

### Introduction

- Live sports production has traditionally been done with dedicated hardware and crews in trucks, leading to high costs, inflexibility, and significant carbon emissions.
- AWS and its partners have been working on "Live Cloud Production," which leverages the cloud to enable scalable, flexible, and efficient live sports production.

### Benefits of Live Cloud Production

- Cost savings: Pay-as-you-go model, minimizing on-premises hardware and upfront investments.
- Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on event size and audience.
- Remote collaboration: Geographical barriers are broken down, enabling teams to work together seamlessly.
- Sustainability: Reduced carbon footprint by using AWS data centers powered by renewable energy and spinning up resources only when needed.
- Experimentation and automation: Freedom to experiment with new workloads, resources, and components, and automate processes using data and AI/ML.

### Sky Sports+ Transformation

- Sky Sports acquired rights for additional sports events, requiring a 50% increase in production capacity with minimal investment and a tight timeline.
- Sky and AWS teams reimagined the entire production chain, leveraging data and automation to create an event-based architecture.
- Key components:
  - Ingesting and moderating data feeds from sports providers
  - Correlating rights and data to automate planning and scheduling
  - Reserving and scaling cloud capacity based on event requirements
  - Deploying live production resources (vision mixing, graphics, etc.) on-demand
  - Processing, encoding, and distributing content to various platforms
  - Powering customer experiences with event data and AI-driven highlights

### Results and Lessons Learned

- Delivered 7,000 hours of content across 3,420 events in just 5 months
- Supported up to 50 concurrent events (tested up to 100)
- Achieved 98% reduction in carbon emissions and 10x reduction in operational overhead
- Reduced CapEx by avoiding traditional infrastructure buildout
- Challenges: Data accuracy, capacity planning, video interoperability, operational practices, and FinOps
- Leveraging AI/ML for highlights, smarter operations, predictive monitoring, and more

### Future Outlook

- Plans to extend the event-based architecture to other sports, including Premier League
- Continued focus on collaboration, testing, and adopting emerging technologies (e.g., uncompressed cloud, grid computing)
- Exploration of generative AI and its applications in sports production and operations
