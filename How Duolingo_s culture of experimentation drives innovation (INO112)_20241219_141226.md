# AWS re:Invent 2024 - How Duolingo's Culture of Experimentation Drives Innovation

## Introduction
- Ellen Cowan (AWS Innovation Specialist) and Sean Colombo (VP of Engineering at Duolingo) discuss Duolingo's culture of experimentation and how it drives innovation.
- Duolingo grew 10x users over six years and 2x stock price over two years through product iteration and experimentation.

## Culture Sets the Tone
- Duolingo's mission: "Build the world's best education and make it universally available."
- 12 operating principles, visualized with their owl mascot Duo, guide decision-making (e.g., "Learners First," "Never Settle on Talent," "Reduce Complexity," "Be Candid and Kind").
- Principles foster a culture of experimentation, learning, and psychological safety.

## Experiments Lead to Growth
- Duolingo runs around 300 experiments at any given time, embracing incremental gains (e.g., 1% improvements) that compound over time.
- They have an internal A/B testing platform that makes it easy for anyone to launch, monitor, and shut down experiments quickly.
- The "ship it" principle emphasizes getting experiments in front of users rapidly to start realizing compound gains.

## Copy, Then Innovate
- Duolingo adopted successful features from other apps (e.g., leaderboards from mobile games) as a starting point, resulting in an 18% increase in user sessions.
- Copying proven concepts first, then innovating on them, accelerates iteration and reduces risk.

## Product-Centric Approach
- Teams are organized around metrics and missions tied to customer value, not just features.
- A "green machine" rapid iteration process is used across teams, even non-product teams like marketing.
- Engagement drives monetization and sustainability in a product-centric flywheel.

## Engineering Matters
- Microservices, Kubernetes (EKS), and the "golden path" concept enable rapid, scalable experimentation.
- The "golden path" provides curated tech stacks for easy adoption while allowing customization with team ownership.

## Key Takeaways
- Customer obsession and a culture of experimentation drove Duolingo's explosive growth.
- Launching many small experiments, embracing failures, and compounding incremental gains are powerful strategies.
- A product-centric operating model with the right engineering foundations enables innovation at scale.
