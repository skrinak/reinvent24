# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Wired differently: Generative AI for Neurodiversity (IDE107)

## Introduction

- Manisha Mehta, lead for disability inclusion efforts at Amazon and AWS outside the US, introduced the topic of neurodiversity and its importance in the workplace.
- Neurodiversity refers to the natural variation in how people think, act, and communicate, and includes conditions like dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, ADHD, and autism.

## Key Insights

### Understanding Neurodiversity

- Neurodiversity is a natural variation, not an atypical condition, and can bring unique strengths and "super skills" when provided with the right environment.
- Only 16% of autistic adults are in full-time employment, and 43% have lost jobs due to lack of understanding and support.
- Employers who focus on neuro-inclusion have reported benefits such as increased focus, creativity, innovation, and authenticity in the workplace.

### Creating a Neuro-Inclusive Environment

- Reducing ambiguity in the workplace is crucial for neuro-inclusion, including:
  - Setting clear performance expectations, goals, and behavior expectations
  - Communicating with clarity and avoiding jargon or reading between the lines
  - Asking individuals what they need to work best and not making assumptions

### AWS Initiatives for Neuro-Inclusion

- AWS is examining its people processes, talent management, and policies through a neuro-inclusive lens.
- Efforts include making job descriptions and interview processes more inclusive, building manager capabilities, and leveraging a community of inclusion ambassadors.
- The goal is to influence AWS builders to create neuro-inclusive solutions and technology for customers.

## Generative AI for Neurodiversity

### Benefits of Generative AI

- Clear and concise communication: Spell-checking, grammar correction, and adherence to writing styles.
- Meeting summarization: Capturing actions and automatically sharing with attendees.
- Planning and scheduling: Breaking down tasks, managing time, and meeting deadlines.
- Feedback and imposter syndrome: Peer review, tone analysis, and validation of ideas.

### Practical Applications

- Matthew Milne, an AWS enterprise support lead, shared examples of how Generative AI is being used internally at Amazon to support neurodiverse builders, such as:
  - Reviewing Cloud Formation templates against the AWS Well-Architected Framework
  - Providing suggestions and referencing relevant documentation
  - Enabling builders to validate their ideas and work before sharing with others

## Conclusion

- Neurodiversity is a competitive advantage that can be supported by Generative AI tools and inclusive practices.
- Appropriate safeguards and adherence to data and AI strategies are essential.
- Supporting and including neurodiverse individuals can help them reach their full potential.
- The key question posed: How can you advocate for and implement AI tools that specifically support neurodiverse builders in your workplace?
