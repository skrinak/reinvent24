# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Scaling Tech Talent for the Automotive Industry via AWS Tech Alliance

## Summary

### Introduction

- The session highlights the importance of workforce development strategies and nurturing the next generation of technical talent to effectively utilize the opportunities presented by technological advancements.
- The focus is on an exciting approach to develop machine learning skills within companies, particularly in the automotive industry.

### Automotive Industry Disruption and the Need for Machine Learning Skills

- The automotive industry is undergoing a disruption, with key trends such as autonomous driving, AI-assisted design processes, digital experiences, and software-defined vehicles.
- These trends underscore the urgent need for machine learning and AI skills within the industry.

### Developing Machine Learning Skills In-House

- Instead of solely relying on external recruitment, the session emphasizes the importance of developing machine learning skills from within the organization.
- This can be achieved by attracting tech talent (students, recent graduates) or reskilling existing employees for new career paths in machine learning.
- Building partnerships with educational institutes and universities is crucial for this approach.

### The DeepRacer Approach

- XL2, a joint venture of Audi and Capgemini, leveraged AWS DeepRacer to fill the machine learning skill gap.
- DeepRacer is a model car where participants learn to program machine learning models to navigate a track as quickly and accurately as possible.
- XL2 combined DeepRacer with a real-life racing event at their depot, surrounded by sports vehicles in the production plant.
- Participants gained hands-on experience in training, evaluating, and tuning reinforcement learning models for autonomous driving.
- The event included workshops, factory tours, and networking opportunities with Audi management.

### AWS Tech Alliance and Applied Learning Events

- The AWS Tech Alliance aims to create regional collaborative ecosystems between customers, partners, educational institutions, and government organizations.
- Applied learning events, such as the DeepRacer event, provide students with opportunities to understand industry contexts and apply machine learning in practice.
- In Germany, AWS has impacted 6,000 students through applied learning events and additional classroom content.
- Globally, AWS has impacted 57,000 students through applied learning events and 250,000 students through classroom content and educator upskilling.

### Benefits and Future Directions

- The Tech Alliance model benefits all key players: educators can attract more students, customers/partners get trained entry-level talent, and collaborating organizations benefit from talent staying in the region.
- AWS is focused on scaling regional models, currently operating in 15 regions with over 1,000 education providers and 650 customers/partners.
- Future activities include bringing underrepresented talent into the industry (e.g., women in cloud) and collaborating with ed tech providers through the Education Equity program.

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- Developing technical talent, especially in machine learning and AI, is crucial for the automotive industry to leverage technological advancements and stay competitive.
- Building partnerships between industry, education, and government organizations is essential for creating a sustainable talent pipeline.
- Applied learning events and hands-on experiences, like the DeepRacer event, are effective in providing students with practical skills and industry context.
- The AWS Tech Alliance model benefits all stakeholders and aims to scale its impact through regional collaborations, diversity initiatives, and partnerships with ed tech providers.
