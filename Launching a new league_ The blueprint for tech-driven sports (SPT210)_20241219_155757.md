# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Launching a New League: The Blueprint for Tech-Driven Sports

## Summary

### Introduction

- John Bradway from CapTech discusses the future of data and its impact on sports.
- CapTech is a national consulting firm that works on complex technology projects, modernization, and data across various sectors, including sports, media, and entertainment.

### The Role of Data in Sports

- **Competition Data**: Scoring, attributes of play, conditions on the field that impact game outcomes. Accuracy and timeliness are crucial.
- **Fan Data**: Information about how individuals follow teams and players, enabling personalization and engagement.
- **Operations Data**: Information about the event, such as time remaining, weather, and traffic, providing context for the game experience.

### Data-Driven Golf: TGL (The Golf League)

- TGL is a new tech-driven golf league launched by Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, and Mike McCarley (former CEO of The Golf Channel).
- It's a team golf format played indoors on virtual courses, with players hitting into a massive screen (Screenzone) and finishing on a real green (Greenzone).
- TGL is built on AWS and uses an event-driven architecture to capture and manage complex data models for broadcasts, gaming partners, and fans.
- The league aims to create new competition formats, engage audiences in innovative ways, and potentially catalyze growth in simulator golf.

### Personalized Fan Experiences: PGA Championship

- The PGA Championship leveraged new app infrastructure and data capabilities to provide personalized fan experiences.
- They mapped out 52 touchpoints across seven different fan personas and used geo-fencing, location tracking, and contextual notifications to enhance the fan experience.
- AI and machine learning were employed to optimize fan journeys, interpret fan flow, and generate personalized content in real-time.
- The data-driven approach resulted in significantly higher engagement rates compared to previous years.

### The Future of Data in Sports

- **Bold Prediction**: Data rights will eventually overcome the value of media rights as sports entities reclaim media rights, go direct-to-consumer, and partners demand more integrated data partnerships.
- CapTech's framework involves data and technology modernization, data rights management, and enabling new products and business model innovation.
- Guiding principles include owning data, knowing fans, creating value, starting now, and fostering ingenuity and creativity in data usage.

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- Data is transforming the sports industry, enabling new competition formats, personalized fan experiences, and innovative business models.
- Owning and controlling data is crucial for sports entities to fully monetize it and create value for fans and partners.
- AI and machine learning are becoming essential for managing complex data streams, optimizing fan journeys, and delivering personalized content at scale.
- Sports leagues and teams must prioritize data rights management, direct-to-consumer strategies, and integrated data partnerships to capitalize on the growing value of data.
- Creativity, ingenuity, and a willingness to take risks in leveraging data will be a defining competitive advantage in the future of tech-driven sports.
