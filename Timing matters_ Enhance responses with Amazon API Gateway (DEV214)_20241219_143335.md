# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Timing matters: Enhance responses with Amazon API Gateway (DEV214)

## Summary

### Introduction

- The session focuses on how timing matters in digital applications and how Amazon API Gateway can help enhance response times for better user experience.
- It covers why timing is crucial, the role of Amazon API Gateway, and features like caching and throttling.

### Why Timing Matters

- Every millisecond counts in the digital world, as response times can make the difference between a satisfied user and a lost one.
- The analogy of waiting in a supermarket line illustrates the importance of timely responses.

### Amazon API Gateway's Role

- API Gateway acts as a bridge between users and backend services like Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EC2, and AWS Lambda functions.
- It provides features like caching, throttling, security, and traffic management to improve performance and user experience.

### Caching

- Caching is the "speed's best friend" as it stores responses and avoids hitting the backend repeatedly.
- It is particularly useful for mobile apps, websites, and user-facing services.

### Throttling

- Throttling protects APIs from being overwhelmed by too many requests.
- It includes burst limits (maximum requests processed at a given time) and rate limits (maximum sustained requests per second).
- By combining caching and throttling, performance can be optimized while maintaining stability during traffic spikes.

### Demo: Implementing Caching with AWS CDK

- The demo showcases implementing caching in Amazon API Gateway using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).
- It involves defining infrastructure as code with AWS CloudFormation and deploying Amazon API Gateway with caching enabled.
- The demo covers cloning a repository, running NPM commands, deploying with CDK, and validating the setup.

### Recap and Call to Action

- Caching reduces API latency and improves performance by avoiding backend calls.
- Throttling prevents APIs from being overwhelmed by too many requests.
- The repository used in the demo is shared via a QR code for attendees to try it themselves.

### Conclusion

- The session emphasizes the importance of timing in digital applications and how Amazon API Gateway's caching and throttling features can enhance user experience.
- A quote from Michelle Obama highlights the importance of hard work, determination, and persistence in achieving goals.
