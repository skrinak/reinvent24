# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Scale with Self-Service Analytics on AWS (ANT334)

## Introduction

- Self-service analytics puts data tools into everyone's hands, not just data experts, helping people make decisions and drive innovation quickly across the organization.
- The global self-service analytics market is expected to reach $13.81 billion by 2029, and 70% of business users want self-service analytics tools to make data-driven decisions without relying on IT or data teams.

## Challenges in Self-Service Analytics

- Extensive ETL pipelines and complex data preparation
- Scattered data across silos, making dataset discovery difficult
- Limited scalability and performance of existing tools
- Technical complexity, requiring special skills and expertise
- Limited advanced analytics capabilities for end-users

## Building Blocks of Self-Service Analytics

### 1. Zero-ETL

- Simplifies data integration across transactional and analytical systems
- Enables real-time data movement without complex ETL pipelines
- Amazon Redshift supports zero-ETL integrations, data sharing, and auto-copy from S3

### 2. Unified Data with Lakehouse

- Provides a single copy of data (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) in one place
- Enables data discoverability and access management
- Supports open standards like Apache Iceberg
- Offers interactive analytics, real-time access, cost-effectiveness, and scalability

### 3. Generative Business Intelligence with QuickSight Q

- AI-powered authoring experience with natural language queries
- AI-assisted data storytelling and narrative explanations
- On-demand answers to questions on dashboards
- Supports unstructured data alongside structured data

### 4. Data Discovery and Access with Amazon DataZone

- Business data catalog for enterprise-wide data discoverability
- Self-service data onboarding and enrichment with business context
- Catalog search using business terms and subscription workflows
- Automated access management and permission handling

### 5. ML for All with Amazon Redshift ML

- Build ML models using SQL on data in Redshift data warehouses
- Choose the best ML algorithm based on the use case
- Pay only for model training; inference included in Redshift cluster

### 6. Simplified Development with SageMaker Unified Studio

- Unified development experience for data preparation, model building, and generative AI app development
- Integrates with EMR, Glue, Athena, Redshift, SageMaker AI, and Bedrock IDE
- Supports collaboration and sharing of compute, data, and code across teams
- Empowers various personas (analysts, engineers, scientists) to solve complex problems together

## Resources and Getting Started

- Blogs and sessions on Glue Studio, EMR Studio, SageMaker Lakehouse, Business Catalog, and Unified Studio
- AWS re:Invent 2024 sessions on SageMaker and Analytics services
