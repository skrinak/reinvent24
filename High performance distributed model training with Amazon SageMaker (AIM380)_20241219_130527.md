# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - High performance distributed model training with Amazon SageMaker (AIM380).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. The amount of training compute required for foundational models is growing exponentially, with the compute doubling every 6 months and the training data doubling every 8 months. This leads to longer training times and unique challenges for distributed model training.

2. Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is designed to address these challenges, offering a resilient and scalable training environment that can accelerate model training by up to 40%.

3. SageMaker Model Parallelism is a PyTorch fork that offers composable training techniques, such as tensor parallelism, context parallelism, and asynchronous checkpointing, to optimize the distributed training stack.

4. SageMaker HyperPod Recipes, announced at this re:Invent, provide optimized configurations for pre-training and fine-tuning large language models like Llama and Mistral on SageMaker infrastructure. With a single line of code, users can seamlessly switch between GPU and Trainium workloads and customize recipes for their own models.

5. Salesforce AI Research has been using SageMaker HyperPod for training various models, including xGen-Sales LLM for sales-focused tasks, SFR-LlamaRank for re-ranking in retrieval systems, and SFR Judge, a state-of-the-art reward model for reinforcement learning.

6. The future of AI research at Salesforce and the industry may involve scaling up post-training and inference-time compute, leading to reasoning models capable of coherent thinking for extended periods and the emergence of multi-agent systems with specialized components and long-running AI processes.
