# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Armed Forces Unite: Connecting Data Across Domains (WPS212)

## Summary

### Introduction

The session focused on how the armed forces of the United States are leveraging data, cloud technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve decision advantage and superiority. The panel consisted of representatives from the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), who discussed their respective approaches and challenges in connecting data across domains.

### Data as a Strategic Asset

- All panelists agreed that data is a strategic asset for the Department of Defense (DoD) and its various branches.
- The Army has been focusing on operationalizing data, building governance, and developing data literacy across the workforce.
- The Air Force views data as a product, measuring success by how much it is accessed and used, rather than just the volume of data.
- DLA emphasized the need for data interoperability and understanding data from DoD, NATO, and foreign partners to support logistics operations.
- The Navy highlighted the importance of data sharing and the need to propagate the understanding of its urgency across the enterprise.

### Cloud Technologies and Infrastructure

- The panelists discussed the importance of infrastructure standards, design patterns, and shared services to enable faster deployment and scalability.
- Challenges include accrediting and integrating various cloud services across different classification levels and air-gapped environments.
- Cross-domain solutions and logical separation of data are crucial for enabling information sharing with coalition partners and foreign allies.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative AI

- The armed forces are actively exploring and operationalizing AI and machine learning (ML) capabilities, including computer vision, natural language processing, and generative AI.
- Key focus areas include demand planning, forecasting, supply chain disruption, and decision support.
- Challenges include data quality, governance, workforce training, and determining the appropriate use cases for AI/ML.
- Generative AI, such as large language models (LLMs), is being explored for various applications, including legal, contracting, and mission planning.
- Concerns around liability, security, and responsible deployment of generative AI models were discussed.

### Data Governance and Security

- Initiatives like Zero Trust and CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) are being implemented to ensure secure data sharing with commercial partners.
- Data-level security and logical segmentation are crucial for enabling cross-domain and coalition information sharing.
- The Navy's Flank Speed initiative aims to consolidate networks and enable data sharing across information domains.

### Key Takeaways

- Decision advantage and superiority are driven by the ability to connect data across domains and leverage AI/ML capabilities.
- Standardization, shared services, and infrastructure design patterns are essential for scalability and interoperability.
- Data governance, security, and workforce training are critical challenges that need to be addressed.
- AI/ML projects must demonstrate clear business cases and measurable outcomes to justify investments and scale adoption.
- Responsible deployment of generative AI models requires addressing liability, security, and ethical concerns.

Overall, the session highlighted the armed forces' efforts to leverage data, cloud technologies, and AI/ML to enhance decision-making, operational resilience, and mission effectiveness while addressing the associated challenges and complexities.
