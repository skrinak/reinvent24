# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - How Air Canada is innovating customer service across lines of business (BIZ211).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Customer Experience Challenges**: Organizations face challenges in providing seamless customer experiences, such as disconnected customer journeys, inefficient agent workflows, lack of integrated data, and slow innovation due to technology barriers.

2. **Importance of Self-Service**: Self-service options are crucial for improving customer experience and reducing contact center costs. 70% of customers prefer self-service over speaking with an agent, and self-service can lead to significant cost savings through increased containment and deflection.

3. **Amazon Connect and Generative AI**: Amazon Connect, AWS's cloud-based contact center solution, leverages AI and machine learning to enhance customer experiences. Generative AI capabilities like Amazon Q for Connect provide real-time agent assistance, conversational self-service, and contact summarization, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.

4. **Air Canada's Transformation Journey**: Air Canada faced challenges with increasing call volumes, manual queue processing, and siloed legacy systems, resulting in high wait times and customer frustration. They embarked on a modernization journey with Amazon Connect and Salesforce Service Cloud, introducing self-service options, callback features, and agent empowerment tools.

5. **Air Canada's Business Results**: Air Canada realized significant benefits from their transformation, including a 15% reduction in overall contact center volumes, an 8% reduction in abandonment rates, 78% containment of informational calls within the IVR, a 20-second reduction in handle time, and savings of 190 FTEs ($4.7 million CAD).

6. **Lessons Learned and Advice**: Extend timelines for migration projects, watch for scope creep, focus on change management and employee engagement, ensure solid knowledge management processes, and thoroughly review contracts to leverage all available features.
