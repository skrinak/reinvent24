# AWS re:Invent 2024 - EQ, Amazon Leadership Principles, and Building Self-Confidence

## Summary

### Introduction
- David Murray (Principal Architect) and Erin Quinn (Principal Account Manager) have been conducting sessions on emotional intelligence, avoiding imposter syndrome, and building self-confidence at Amazon.
- Their focus is on how to avoid imposter syndrome and build self-confidence, which is crucial for a long-term career in tech.

### Key Lessons

#### 1. Focus and Progress
- Successful individuals at Amazon had a narrow focus, which allowed them to make progress and achieve meaningful goals.
- Focus helps distill the noise and concentrate on what's important for you, your team, or your customers.
- Progress is key to sustaining self-confidence and feeling a sense of achievement.

#### 2. Confidence and the Flywheel Effect
- Confidence allows individuals to say "no" and reclaim their time, leading to a flywheel effect of increased focus, progress, and further confidence.
- This translates to Amazon's leadership principles: Dive Deep (focus) → Earn Trust (progress) → Deliver Results → Own More → Think Big.

#### 3. Building Resilience and Long-Term Vision
- Resilience is connected to focus and is essential for sustaining confidence over the long term.
- Having a long-term vision and big goals (e.g., JFK's "We choose to go to the moon") provides resilience and changes narratives, even during stressful times.

### Achieving Results and Building Confidence

#### 1. Seek Help and Accountability
- Seeking help is not a weakness; it involves understanding how others can support you in achieving your goals.
- Find "whos" (people) who can help and share your goals with them to gain their support.
- Have an accountability partner to balance each other out and stay on track.

#### 2. Discipline and Time Management
- Own your calendar and block out dedicated time for focused work on your goals.
- Create routines and protect your time from external distractions and commitments.
- Techniques like the Pomodoro technique, mind mapping, and time tracking can help with focus and productivity.

#### 3. Measure Progress and Analyze Time Spent
- Measure the time you spend on different tasks to ensure you're allocating enough time to meaningful work that aligns with your goals.
- Visualize and analyze your time spent to identify areas for improvement and realignment with your priorities.

### Conclusion
- Overwhelm starts with a lack of focus; take a step back and identify areas to dive deep.
- Progress leads to earning trust and building confidence, which enables saying "no" and reclaiming time for further focus.
- Prioritize and use your time wisely, as you have a limited number of weeks in your lifetime (approximately 4,000 if you live until 80).

The speakers encourage attendees to provide feedback through surveys, as emotional intelligence and mental health topics are crucial for the tech industry.
