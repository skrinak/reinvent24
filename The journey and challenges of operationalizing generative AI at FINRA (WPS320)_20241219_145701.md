# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - The journey and challenges of operationalizing generative AI at FINRA (WPS320).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **FINRA's Background and Cloud Journey**
   - FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) is a regulatory organization that ensures investor protection and market integrity in the financial markets.
   - FINRA is a big data organization with over 600 petabytes of data, and they started their cloud journey about 10 years ago, becoming a cloud-first organization.

2. **FINRA's Vision and Guiding Principles for Generative AI**
   - FINRA sees generative AI as transformative in their way of working with data and expanding possibilities.
   - Their guiding principles include being transformative, mitigating risks, using AI ethically, building purposefully, and including multiple stakeholders.

3. **Challenges in Getting Started with Generative AI**
   - Challenges included groundswell of interest, new risks (legal, technical, ethical), and the need for training and upskilling, especially in prompt engineering.
   - FINRA created a Generative AI Coalition to prioritize use cases and navigate the change.

4. **Initial Pilots with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q Developer**
   - FINRA introduced FILLIP (FINRA Large Language Interactive Portal) based on Amazon Bedrock for business users.
   - They also rolled out FINRA's Developer Assistant based on Amazon Q Developer for their engineering teams.

5. **FINRA's Developer Assistant with Amazon Q Developer**
   - FINRA conducted a 5-month R&D effort to evaluate tools and established an evaluation framework.
   - They ran a 2-month pilot with 60 engineers across 14 teams, focusing on code transformation, test code generation, project onboarding, and code documentation.
   - The pilot saw improvements in code quality, reduction in code transformation time, and increased productivity.

6. **Operationalizing Amazon Q Developer**
   - FINRA rolled out Amazon Q Developer in two phases, starting with 15% of their engineers.
   - They established prerequisites like usage terms, training, documentation, and a community of practice.
   - Ongoing efforts include monitoring metrics, adjusting guardrails, and maturing towards agentic AI technologies.

## Key Insights

- Operationalizing generative AI requires a comprehensive approach, including establishing governance, security, legal frameworks, and addressing people, process, and organizational changes.
- Prompt engineering training and best practices are crucial for effective and cost-efficient use of generative AI.
- Iterative rollouts, pilots, and continuous monitoring are essential for successful enterprise-wide adoption of generative AI solutions.
- Partnering with AWS and leveraging native capabilities like Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q Developer can accelerate the adoption of generative AI while addressing security and governance concerns.

## Important Conclusions

- FINRA has successfully piloted and operationalized generative AI solutions like Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q Developer, seeing improvements in productivity, code quality, and innovation.
- Operationalizing generative AI requires a strategic approach, addressing technical, legal, ethical, and organizational challenges through frameworks, training, and iterative rollouts.
- Continuous monitoring, adjustment of guardrails, and maturing towards agentic AI technologies are part of FINRA's future plans for generative AI adoption.
