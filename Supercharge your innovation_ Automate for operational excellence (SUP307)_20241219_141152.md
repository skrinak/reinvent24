# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Supercharge your innovation_ Automate for operational excellence (SUP307).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Operational Excellence and AWS Best Practices**
   - Operational excellence is the continuous improvement of operations to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in delivering business outcomes.
   - AWS best practices include building for failure (resilient workloads), identifying and remediating risks, prioritizing security, and optimizing resources.

2. **Automating Repetitive Infrastructure Tasks**
   - Three use cases were discussed:
     - Automating security group changes based on AWS Config rules and resource tags.
     - Automating the deletion of unattached EBS volumes based on organizational policies and resource tags.
     - Automating the rotation of RDS SSL certificates based on resource tags and parameters.
   - Benefits of automation include reducing wait times, saving costs, and mitigating risk exposure.

3. **Building a Cloud Automation Practice**
   - Automation is only half the story; building a cloud automation practice is crucial for achieving operational excellence at scale.
   - Key concepts: the automation flywheel, tenets (guardrails), and the integration of people, processes, and technology.
   - People: Roles include users, governance team, developers, and security.
   - Processes: Prioritization metrics, automation development lifecycle, and continuous improvement cycles.
   - Technology: Examples of automating IAM operations and support case handling using AI/ML.

4. **Leveraging Managed Services for Acceleration**
   - Customers can leverage managed service providers to accelerate their cloud automation practice journey.
   - Managed services offer pre-built automation building blocks and expertise.
   - Customers should aim to reduce dependency on managed services over time as they mature.

## Key Insights

- Tagging is crucial for enabling automation and providing context for decision-making.
- Standardization and centralization are key to scaling automation efforts across an organization.
- Cross-team collaboration, an "automation-first" mindset, and cultural shifts are essential for building a successful cloud automation practice.
- Automation should be driven by data, prioritized based on impact and urgency, and measured from day one.
- AI/ML can be leveraged to automate complex tasks, such as IAM policy management and support case handling.

## Important Conclusions

- Automating repetitive infrastructure tasks can significantly improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate risks.
- Building a cloud automation practice requires a holistic approach that integrates people, processes, and technology, with a focus on continuous improvement.
- Managed service providers can accelerate an organization's cloud automation practice journey by providing pre-built automation and expertise.
- Organizations should start by automating a single task, measure the impact, and use it as a case for building a cloud automation practice.
