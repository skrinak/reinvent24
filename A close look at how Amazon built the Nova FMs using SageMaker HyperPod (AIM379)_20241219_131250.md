# AWS re:Invent 2024 - A Close Look at How Amazon Built the Nova FMs Using SageMaker HyperPod

## Introduction

- The session discusses the challenges faced by Amazon's AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) team in building the Nova Foundation Models (FMs) and how they addressed these challenges.
- It also covers how Amazon SageMaker HyperPod helps solve these challenges for foundation model development.

## Overview of Amazon Nova Foundation Models

- Amazon Nova is a family of foundation models, including Nova Micro, Nova Lite, Nova Pro, G8, Canvas, and Reel.
- These models support various input modalities (text, image, video) and output modalities (text, image, video).
- Nova Premier, Amazon's most capable multimodal model with advanced reasoning capabilities, will be released in Q1 of next year.

## Challenges in Foundation Model Development

### Data Acquisition and Processing
- Procuring massive amounts of diverse data across languages and modalities.
- Processing the data to filter out irrelevant content, toxicity, bias, and duplicates.
- Normalizing and tokenizing the data for consumption.

### Model Architecture and Training
- Experimenting with various model architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
- Pre-training phase: Compute-intensive training on large clusters spanning tens of thousands of accelerators for months.
- Fine-tuning phase: Specializing the generalized model for specific tasks or capabilities.

### Scaling Challenges
- Memory wall: Models require exponentially increasing memory as they grow larger.
- Compute wall: Optimal training requires a quadratic or greater increase in compute as models grow larger.

## Parallelization Strategies

To overcome the memory and compute walls, Amazon employs the following parallelization strategies:

1. **Tensor Parallelism**: Slicing individual layers horizontally and spreading calculations across multiple accelerators.
2. **Pipeline Parallelism**: Splitting sequences of layers across stages and passing computations between stages.
3. **Data Parallelism**: Replicating the model across multiple accelerators and reconciling their values periodically.

## Dealing with Entropy and Failures

- Entropy increases as more components are added to the system, leading to a higher probability of failures.
- Amazon sees failures 10-20 times per day at scale, including GPU/NPU failures, cosmic ray bit flips, and silent data corruption.
- Strategies to deal with failures:
  - Early planning and burn-in testing to identify manufacturing defects.
  - Passive adaptive monitoring for error signals and secondary performance indicators.
  - Efficient and asynchronous checkpointing.
  - Redundant capacity with hot spares ready to take over.
  - Comprehensive metric collection and meaningful visualization.
  - Measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) like GoodPut.
  - Failing fast and prioritizing recovery.

## SageMaker HyperPod for Foundation Model Development

SageMaker HyperPod is a resilient environment that productizes Amazon's learnings in foundation model development, including:

- Self-healing clusters with deep health checks.
- Optimized libraries for parallelization techniques (data, tensor, pipeline).
- User interfaces (SageMaker Studio) and command-line tools for job submission and management.
- Container insights for MLOps engineers.
- EC2 ultra-clusters with EFA and high-performance storage.
- Software layers (drivers, communication libraries, frameworks, optimization libraries).
- Automatic fault node replacement and checkpointing.
- Accelerator-level observability for utilization optimization.
- Flexibility in orchestration (Amazon EKS, Slurm), job submission tools, observability, and training/tuning interfaces.
- Pre-built images with device drivers and toolkits.
- Choice of hardware configurations (Trinium instances, P5 instances with H100/H200, storage options, EFA networking).

## Recent SageMaker HyperPod Launches

- **HyperPod Task Governance Tools**: Distribute compute across multiple teams, define priorities for training jobs, and improve cluster utilization.
- **HyperPod Recipes**: Pre-benchmarked and optimized recipes for open-source models like LLAMA and Mistral, saving data scientists weeks or months of tuning.

## Key Takeaways

1. HyperPod reduces time spent on infrastructure management.
2. HyperPod is resilient to failures with auto-healing capabilities.
3. HyperPod provides flexibility in choosing tools and configurations.
4. HyperPod helps reduce costs significantly for foundation model development.
