# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Optimizing network efficiency & strengthening multicloud connectivity (MAE308).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **The New York Times' Cloud Journey**
   - Initially, NYT divided their workloads between on-premises and two public cloud providers (AWS and another).
   - Recently, they decided to migrate 80-90% of their workload from the other public cloud to AWS.
   - The presentation covers their journey of migrating workloads, laying the foundation, and optimizing operations.

2. **Building an Internal Developer Platform**
   - Goals: Consistent experience, efficiency, integrations, scalability, and visibility.
   - Architecture: Multi-account setup with a centralized platform account on EKS, and separate accounts for engineering teams.
   - Challenges: Network efficiency, cost optimization, and multi-cloud connectivity.

3. **Optimizing Network Efficiency and Multi-Cloud Connectivity**
   - Constraints: Most traffic between US East regions, 10 Gbps bandwidth requirement.
   - Solution: Leveraging partner virtual routers and direct connectivity to cloud providers.
   - Design Considerations: High availability, least privileged access, routing decisions (BGP, BFD, ECMP).
   - Challenges: IP space overlap, different cloud provider constructs, cost optimization.

4. **Key Takeaways and Benefits**
   - 60% reduction in data transfer costs by eliminating egress costs between cloud providers.
   - 20-40% improvement in HTTP latency for applications communicating across cloud providers.
   - 50% reduction in security costs by reducing exposed surfaces.
   - Faster migration and innovation through self-service capabilities and improved multi-cloud connectivity.

## Important Conclusions

The New York Times successfully optimized their network efficiency and strengthened multi-cloud connectivity by implementing a solution leveraging partner virtual routers and direct connectivity to cloud providers. This architecture enabled significant cost savings, improved application performance, and enhanced security while facilitating faster migration and innovation through self-service capabilities.
