# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Explore whatâ€™s new in analytics and governance (ANT303).txt

# Summary

## Key Points

- AWS DataZone is a service that catalogs, discovers, shares, and governs data across organizational boundaries, enabling a data mesh or data fabric architecture.
- DataZone addresses common challenges faced by enterprises, such as siloed data, complex governance rules, and discoverability of machine learning models.
- Recent features added to DataZone include generative AI for auto-generating descriptions, data quality metrics integration, fine-grained access controls, business unit organization, data products, subscription workflows, SageMaker integration, JDBC query capability, semantic search, and automated data lineage.
- DataZone is the foundation for the Modern Data Foundation and the new Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio, providing a governed data layer across data stores, analytics, and AI/ML workflows.

## Customer Stories

### Cisco (Outshift Business Unit)

- Outshift faced challenges with siloed data, complex governance rules, and discoverability of ML models.
- They adopted a data mesh approach using DataZone, which enabled domain ownership, treating data as a product, self-service access, and federated computational governance.
- DataZone accelerated innovation by providing a unified catalog, enabling cross-domain data access, and improving visibility of ML models.

### The Weather Company

- The Weather Company ingests and processes petabytes of data daily, facing challenges with data cataloging, lineage, and exploration.
- They implemented a "data fabric" architecture using DataZone, enabling centralized oversight, streamlined privacy reviews, and accelerated product decisions.
- DataZone provided a centralized glossary, facilitated cross-team data access, onboarded diverse data sources, and established tagging guidelines.
- Their roadmap includes making "data gov ops" a core discipline, adopting the SageMaker Unified Studio, and enabling open lineage and data observability.

## Key Insights and Conclusions

- DataZone addresses common data challenges faced by enterprises, enabling data democratization with built-in governance.
- It facilitates data mesh and data fabric architectures, providing a unified catalog, data lineage, and self-service access across organizational boundaries.
- Customer stories highlight how DataZone accelerated innovation, improved collaboration, and enabled better data governance and discoverability.
- AWS continues to enhance DataZone with new features and integrations, positioning it as the foundation for the Modern Data Foundation and SageMaker Unified Studio.
