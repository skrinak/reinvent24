# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - Beyond productivity_ Using generative AI to grow in financial services (FSI202).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Generative AI in Financial Services**
   - The session explored how leading financial institutions are leveraging generative AI to drive efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in their operations.
   - Speakers from Bridgewater Associates, MUFG, and Crypto.com shared their experiences and use cases.

2. **Bridgewater Associates: Artificial Investment Associate (AIA)**
   - Bridgewater developed AIA, a multi-agent architecture that can break down complex investment research tasks into smaller steps.
   - AIA can propose relationships, find data, perform analysis, synthesize results, and update its understanding iteratively.
   - The system combines large language models (LLMs) with human expertise and feedback for better accuracy and oversight.

3. **MUFG: Transforming Corporate Sales Activities**
   - MUFG used generative AI to streamline the process of understanding client situations and originating solutions.
   - Their platform extracts relevant data from documents, generates ideas and presentation materials, and adapts through feedback loops (GenAIOps).
   - This approach increased lead generation by 10 times while maintaining a 30% conversion rate.

4. **Crypto.com: Improving Market Sentiment Analysis**
   - Crypto.com developed a multi-agent consensus workflow to analyze news sentiment and market impact for cryptocurrencies.
   - The system translates news into English, uses multiple LLMs for evaluation, and continuously fine-tunes the models.
   - This solution achieved over 90% accuracy and enabled rapid deployment within six weeks.
