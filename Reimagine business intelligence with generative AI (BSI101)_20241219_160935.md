# AWS re:Invent 2024 - Reimagine Business Intelligence with Generative AI

## Introduction

- The session was presented by Jesse Gebhardt, leader of the QuickSight Solution Architecture team worldwide.
- It covered how generative AI can help all users get more insights out of their data using Amazon Q in QuickSight.

## Brief History of Business Intelligence Capabilities

- In the 80s and 90s, BI was typically static, tabular reporting done by highly skilled developers for a small group of senior leaders.
- In the late 2000s, interactive drag-and-drop dashboarding emerged, enabling business analysts to build dashboards and share insights with a larger community.
- While dashboards enabled more people to access insights, they often led to a proliferation of dashboards with slight variations, creating multiple sources of truth.

## The Opportunity with Generative AI

- Generative AI is good at accessing broad world knowledge, learning and teaching, summarizing information, and handling specific textual tasks.
- BI is designed to answer precise questions, automate data preparation, and deliver insights to others while verifying the truth of the data.
- Combining generative AI and BI capabilities leads to "Generative BI," enabling anyone to gain insights and ask questions by typing in natural language.
