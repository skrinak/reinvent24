# AWS re:Invent 2024 - The Modern CI/CD Toolbox: Strategies for Consistency and Reliability

## Introduction

- The session aims to tackle the challenges of scaling CI/CD in complex environments and share insights that attendees can apply in their organizations.
- The speakers are AWS Heroes and former Heroes, with expertise in CI/CD and DevOps practices.

## Defining CI/CD

- Continuous Integration (CI): Developers work on code, commit to source control, perform unit tests, integration tests, security scans, and create a deployable artifact.
- Continuous Delivery (CD): The deployable artifact is deployed to staging and production environments, with manual approval before production.
- Continuous Deployment: An automated process that takes the artifact all the way to production, often using feature flags.

## A New Look at Changes

- Traditionally, there are separate processes for configuration changes, infrastructure changes, and application changes, leading to inconsistencies, increased risk of errors, and fragmented audit trails.
- The proposed approach is to version control everything, including encrypted secrets, to ensure consistency, auditability, and atomic changes.
- Version control should encompass application code, configuration, and infrastructure.
- Implement an integrated approval process, testing, unified deployment, and rollback for all types of changes.

## Code Signing and Attestation

- Code signing verifies that the code hasn't been altered, while artifact attestation ensures the authenticity and integrity of software artifacts.
- Signing every commit ensures a verifiable history of changes, provides protection against tampering, and enables an auditable trace.
- Code signing and attestation prevent unauthorized code changes, supply chain attacks, and tampering, but don't protect against vulnerabilities in the code or runtime attacks.
- The decision to implement code signing and attestation depends on the project's needs and risk assessment.

## GitOps

- GitOps combines Git and operations, treating infrastructure components as code.
- It empowers developers to make deployment decisions by pushing changes to a Git repository, which triggers automated deployment processes.
- AWS services like CloudFormation Git Sync, CodePipeline V2, and CodeCatalyst support GitOps practices.
- The CNOE project helps experiment with GitOps on local environments.

## Generative AI for Deployment Decisions

- Generative AI can assist in drafting release summaries, assessing the impact of changes, and potentially automating deployment decisions based on learned patterns.
- Projects like Amazon Bedrock aim to integrate generative AI into the deployment workflow, but more work is needed to fully leverage this technology.

## Deployment Strategies

- Rolling deployment: Updating instances incrementally, ensuring continuous availability.
- Blue-green deployment: Setting up two identical environments and shifting traffic to the new version after validation.
- Canary deployment: Releasing the new version to a small subset of users, monitoring for issues, and gradually increasing the rollout.
- Real-time monitoring and automatic rollback mechanisms are crucial for all deployment strategies.

## Drift Detection and Prevention

- Drift occurs when manual changes are made to the production environment, bypassing the CI/CD pipeline.
- Strategies to detect drift include CloudFormation drift detection, AWS CloudTrail alerts, and monitoring Terraform state files.
- The recommended approach is to remove admin access to production environments for developers and implement a "break glass" pipeline for emergency deployments.

## Pipeline Consistency

- Pipeline consistency ensures that all services follow the same standards and best practices, making it easier for developers to understand and work across projects.
- A centralized team can provide extendable templates and constructs, while teams are responsible for updating and fixing their pipelines.
- This approach allows flexibility while enforcing organizational standards and guidelines.

## Continuous Configuration and Feature Flags

- Continuous Configuration (CC) enables dynamic adjustments to application behavior without redeploying code, using feature flags.
- Feature flags allow rolling out new features to a limited audience, conducting experiments, and limiting the impact of changes.
- Separating deployment from feature releases reduces risk, enables safer testing in production, and allows for faster deployments.

## Avoiding Vendor Lock-in

- The Projen-pipelines project aims to provide portable and flexible CI/CD pipelines, independent of the underlying tooling.
- Pipelines are defined in TypeScript as constructs, abstracting away implementation details.
- The project supports generating pipelines for GitHub, GitLab, and AWS tooling, with plans to extend to other platforms.

## Key Takeaways

- Automation is foundational for modern CI/CD, ensuring consistency and speed.
- Implement code signing and attestation as needed to ensure authenticity and integrity.
- Have proper rollback strategies for deployments and continuous configuration.
- Detect and prevent drift in your environments.
- Standardize pipelines and enforce best practices across your organization.
- Adopt continuous configuration and feature flags to separate deployment from feature releases.
- Explore tools like Projen-pipelines to avoid vendor lock-in and maintain flexibility.
