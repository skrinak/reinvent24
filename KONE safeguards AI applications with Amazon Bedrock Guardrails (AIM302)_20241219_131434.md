# Summary of AWS re_Invent 2024 - KONE safeguards AI applications with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails (AIM302).txt

# Summary

## Main Points

1. **Amazon Bedrock Guardrails** is AWS's flagship service for responsible AI, providing safeguards and policies to build safe generative AI applications.

2. Guardrails offers various policies and filters to protect against harmful content, prompt attacks, denied topics, personally identifiable information (PII), specific word filters, and hallucinations.

3. The newly announced **Automated Reasoning Check** identifies factual claims in responses and suggests corrections when they're fabricated, ensuring factual accuracy.

4. Guardrails supports multimodal applications, allowing safeguards for both text and images, including the latest image generation models.

5. **KONE Corporation**, a global leader in elevators and escalators, partnered with AWS to build the **Technician Assistant**, a generative AI application to assist field service engineers.

6. The Technician Assistant leverages KONE's documentation, manuals, and historical data to provide relevant instructions and solutions for equipment maintenance and repairs.

7. KONE utilized various Bedrock models, including Claude 3 and the latest Anthropic models, for different tasks in the pipeline, such as query generation, relevance evaluation, and instruction generation.

8. KONE implemented Bedrock Guardrails' relevance check capability, resulting in faster and more cost-effective responses compared to their in-house solution.
