# Summary: Achieving Dynamic Power Grid Operations with AWS

## Introduction

- Electricity demand is expected to triple in the next two decades due to electrification of various sectors.
- Renewable energy sources are becoming more prevalent and cost-effective, but they are less predictable and geographically spread out compared to traditional power plants.
- Power grids are becoming congested and less reliable, making it challenging for grid operators to maintain a stable supply.
- AWS is committed to supporting a sustainable future and is working with utilities and grid operators to help them transition to clean energy by building new technologies and innovating on AWS.

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Lack of a Single Source of Truth for Grid Infrastructure

- Grids are made up of millions of interconnected physical assets owned and managed by different entities, leading to a lack of a unified view of the grid's current state.
- AWS is working with customers like Duke Energy to develop solutions that can run complex power flow simulations at scale on AWS, enabling faster analysis and planning for grid improvements.

### 2. Simulation at Scale

- Simulating power flows based on planned or unplanned changes is critical for reliable grid operations and expansion planning.
- AWS collaborated with the Pacific Northwest National Labs to perform large-scale stochastic analyses, running over 131 million power flow simulations in less than an hour, providing insights into potential grid bottlenecks and guiding investment decisions.

### 3. Unlocking Real-Time Insights from Smart Meter Data

- Traditional meter data systems were built for monthly billing purposes, limiting the potential for real-time optimization of demand and supply.
- AWS worked with Vector, a New Zealand energy company, to build Diverge, a cloud-native energy data platform that processes high-frequency smart meter data at scale, enabling richer insights and supporting decarbonization goals.

## Conclusion

- AWS is helping utilities and grid operators transition to a software-defined or dynamic grid, where real-time data drives insights and continuous optimization of grid operations.
- By leveraging AWS's expertise in data, analytics, and optimization at scale, utilities can accelerate the transition to carbon-free renewable energy and address the challenges of a more dynamic and distributed energy landscape.
- AWS is building, testing, and proving key enabling technologies that make the dynamic grid a reality, collaborating with customers and partners worldwide.
