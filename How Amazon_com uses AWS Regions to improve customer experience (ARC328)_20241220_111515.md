# AWS re:Invent 2024 - How Amazon.com uses AWS Regions to Improve Customer Experience

## Introduction

- The speakers are Frank Stone (Principal Solutions Architect at AWS) and Lisa Gutermuth (Principal Software Engineer at Amazon).
- They discuss how Amazon.com leverages AWS Regions to improve customer experience, sharing their learnings, strategies, and tools.

## Amazon's Journey to Multi-Region Architecture

### Motivations

- Availability, latency, costs, data regulations, and new business opportunities drove Amazon's decision to adopt a multi-region architecture.

### Approach

- Amazon started with a "region expansion" focus, aiming to replicate existing infrastructure in new regions.
- However, unlike AWS, Amazon also needs to move data across regions to provide a seamless customer experience.
- The journey involved prototyping, experiments, and actual migrations to uncover challenges and refine the strategy.

### Learnings

- Configuration management became a significant challenge due to historical assumptions and hard-coded region references.
- Maintaining a service graph and understanding dependencies between services and data proved crucial.
- Modernizing legacy systems, adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and embracing eventual consistency where possible simplified the process.

## Considerations for Selecting AWS Regions

### Latency and Consistency

- Cross-region latency can impact application performance and needs to be evaluated.
- Eventual consistency may be an option for some use cases, simplifying data synchronization across regions.

### Region Types

- Classic Regions are accessible by default, while Opt-in Regions require explicit enablement for enhanced security.
- Opt-in Regions have differences in instance types, APIs, and service availability, which may require application adjustments.

### Planning and Capacity

- Audit service availability in the target region and plan for large-scale events like Cyber Monday.
- Engage with AWS Service Teams for guidance on scaling and any limitations.

## Migration Strategies and Tools

### Migration Strategies

- New Build: Creating infrastructure and applications directly in the new region.
- Planned Transition: Staged migration with a planned outage and cutover.
- Live Migration: Building out the stack in the new region, synchronizing data, and shifting traffic gradually.

### Networking and Connectivity

- VPC Peering and Transit Gateway Peering enable connectivity between regions.
- AWS PrivateLink now supports cross-region connectivity for services and resources.

### Data Migration

- Amazon S3:
  - Cross-Region Replication (CRR) for ongoing replication.
  - S3 Batch Replication for initial data transfer.
- Amazon DynamoDB:
  - Global Tables for multi-region replication.
  - Backup and restore approach.
- Databases (e.g., Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS):
  - Read Replica approach for eventual consistency.
  - Cross-Region Backup and Restore.

## Key Takeaways

- Leverage multiple AWS Regions for improved latency, failover, load balancing, and data privacy.
- Plan ahead, address technical debt, and adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.
- Strategically select target regions based on requirements and considerations.
- Utilize AWS tools and services designed for cross-region migration and replication.

The speakers encourage attendees to engage with AWS Service Teams, attend related sessions, and explore the latest announcements for additional insights and tools.
