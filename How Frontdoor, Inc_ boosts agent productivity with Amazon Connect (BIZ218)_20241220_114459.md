# AWS re:Invent 2024 - How Frontdoor, Inc. boosts agent productivity with Amazon Connect

## Introduction

- Great customer service requires careful coordination across all teams and functions within an organization.
- Customer service agents operate at the front line, providing great customer experience through expert knowledge and capabilities.
- The number one driver of customer satisfaction is being able to solve a problem on the first contact.
- Amazon Connect was designed to build an intuitive application that enables customer service agents to focus solely on the customer.

## Driving Agent Productivity

### Challenges Faced by Agents

- Data everywhere: Customer information is often siloed in disconnected systems.
- Navigating multiple tools and applications to deliver great customer experience.
- Needing access to the right knowledge (product information, company policies, customer insights) to solve problems.
- Listening, interpreting, and problem-solving while providing a great experience within a few minutes of conversation.

### Amazon Connect's Approach

- Step-by-step guides: Visual guided workflows that step agents through every step necessary to solve a problem.
- Amazon Q in Connect: Generative AI-powered assistant that provides tailored recommendations and responses to agents based on customer queries and company knowledge.
- Unified agent workspace: Pulls together capabilities like omnichannel, contact handling, case management, knowledge management, and task management into a single pane of glass.

### Connecting Self-Service and Agents

- Self-service and agent experiences are often disconnected, leading to duplication and inconsistencies.
- Amazon Connect uses common capabilities to power both self-service and agent experiences, avoiding duplication and ensuring seamless transitions between channels.
- The same step-by-step guides and Amazon Q in Connect capabilities can be used for both self-service and agent experiences.
- Shared capabilities allow for consistent experiences, generate shared insights, and enable one change to be deployed everywhere.

## Frontdoor, Inc.'s Experience with Amazon Connect

- Frontdoor, Inc. is a leading provider of home warranties in the United States, operating with two main brands: American Home Shield and Frontdoor.
- They faced challenges with a complex product, seasonal demand spikes, and a shift towards digital-native customers.
- Amazon Connect helped Frontdoor accelerate agent onboarding, drive productivity, and test into AI capabilities.

### Key Benefits and Outcomes

- Rapidly transitioned 2,000 agents to work from home within 12 days during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Implemented courtesy callback, reducing the number of people waiting more than five minutes by half.
- Improved visibility into agent metrics and productivity, enabling better coaching and support.
- Automated task management and follow-up reminders, improving commitment to customers.
- Leveraged Contact Lens for automated QA and documentation, reducing after-call work for agents.
- Piloting Generative AI (Amazon Q in Connect and Bedrock) for contract coverage decisions and proactive assistance during calls.

## Advice for Embedding Generative AI

- Start small with simple, transactional use cases.
- Be prepared for the process to take longer, require more work, and be more expensive than anticipated.
- Resist pressure to move faster; iterate and learn gradually.
- Build a dedicated team focused solely on experimenting, building models, and iterating without distractions.

## Conclusion

- CX transformation is not just about technology; Amazon Connect is here to help organizations on their journey through workshops, training, and support.
- Upcoming sessions at re:Invent 2024 will provide more insights into how customers are driving outcomes with Amazon Connect.
